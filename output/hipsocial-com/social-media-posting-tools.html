                    <p>While social media posting is a great way to carry out prospect and client outreach, there are ways to do it right and ways to do it wrong. If you are laboriously creating your posts, splitting hairs about the hashtags and spending a lot of time personally answering all your DMs, you are not doing it the right way. The right way is to put social media posting tools like (<a href="https://hipsocial.com/">Hipsocial</a> to work and automating the process. The time thus saved can be better deployed for strategic planning.</p>

<p>Social media posting tools can seamlessly manage administrative tasks that include posting, tracking and reporting enabling a business to enhance their brand presence in the optimal way. What’s more one needs to spend very little time on this on a day to day basis. The sign of a truly outstanding social media automation system is that it is something that is not discernible to the target audience. It just does its job well and unobtrusively. </p>

<h1><strong>Understanding Social Media Automation</strong></h1>

<p>Social Media Automation involves the using of social media posting tools to manage the organized and systematic social media posting to augment one’s social media presence.</p>

<h2><strong>The Best Way to Use Social Media Posting Tools</strong></h2>

<p>The process of integrating social media posting tools into your workflow may take a little time in the beginning, especially for small set ups. But once it’s done the right way, it seamlessly takes over tedious and repetitive tasks, freeing up one’s time to focus on strategic functions.</p>

<p>There are a few things that one has to take into account to make the process work optimally for you.</p>

<h3>The Same Message is Not to be Posted on Every Platform</h3>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/social-media-posting-tools-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="social media platforms" /></p>

<p>Your messages have to be customized for each of the social media platforms to be really effective. One might imagine that posting the same message across platforms is very convenient, but your credibility may take something of a hit. Even if a tool or a social media platform offers such a facility, it would not be cool to use it.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that audiences have varied expectations depending upon their demographics and it would make a brand look very poor, if the trouble to tweak the message to suit the particular platform’s requirements is not taken. Among the things that you have to pay special attention to are the user handles,  image specs, hashtag and language and vocabulary, all of which might need adjustment.</p>

<h3>Tailor the Schedule of the Posts According to The Audience’s Convenience-</h3>

<p>Your prospects and clients’ convenience takes precedence over yours. Everything that a business does has to be dictated by the audience’s preferences. This means that you should post when they are online and not when you can spare time.</p>

<h1><strong>The important steps that you have to take to automate and optimize your social media postings are:</strong></h1>

<p>Deploy a scheduling tool to create your posts in advance. 
Analyze your analytics and schedule the release of your posts to coincide with your audience’s time of being online.</p>

<p>The social media posting timetable will be also decided by the kind of platforms that you have chosen. Your analytical tool can help you arrive at the most suitable time to post on the different social media platforms. </p>

<h3>Keep Monitoring the Tools</h3>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/social-media-posting-tools-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="keep monitoring the tools" /></p>

<p>The tools can’t be left to run indefinitely on their own as they need human oversight to be really effective. You may be a solo player or part of a major corporate organization, it would make eminent sense to deploy a tool that comes equipped with an approval process. </p>

<p>This will make sure that there are no mistakes in the posts, particularly of the kind that can negatively impact brand image. Another reason to not have a hands off approach to automated posting is the fact that the world witnesses major events and crises that have a direct bearing on the appropriateness of your messaging and you have to be mindful of that. If you planned on holding a rock concert, but had to shelve the plans on account of the pandemic, you can’t carry on with messaging publicising the event vociferously. </p>

<h3>You Can’t Automate the Comments-</h3>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/social-media-posting-tools-5.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="automate the comments" /></p>

<p>The comments have to appear genuine and not manufactured. The one size fits all, cookie-cutter approach is surely not the best way to make your outreach standout. It isn’t a good idea to use bots to follow and unfollow people, like posts and indeed leave comments that are part of a template, because that would be the easiest way to sabotage assiduously built relationships.</p>

<p>You do not want the word to go out to the world and particularly to your prospects that you are insincere and not at all genuine in your interactions. It is well worth your time to invest in a relationship that is based upon authentic human interactions. That is what will help improve your analytics and improve your social media ROI.</p>

<p>You should leverage your office automation tools smartly in that you are able to manage your direct messages, tags and comments in a centralized manner that allows you to reach out at the required scale in a manner that suits the prospects.</p>

<h3>Strengthen the Process With 24x7 Customer Support-</h3>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/social-media-posting-tools-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="customer support" /></p>

<p>76% of the messages that businesses receive via social media have to do with customer service issues. Luckily one can use a chatbot or auto-response facility to take care of any customer query. Not caring to respond to customer queries may cost you very dearly in terms of offended prospects and customers.</p>

<h3>Pay Attention to The Conversation-</h3>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/social-media-posting-tools-4.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="pay attention to the conversation" /></p>

<p>The great thing about using social media posting tools is the fact that it lets you track which way the audience communication is headed. You can use social listening tools to help you propagate your cause in various ways. This can be done by way of tracking audience sentiment, collecting user generated content and flagging malicious content going towards your target audience. You can really leverage social media tools quite well to boost coverage.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">According to <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/best-social-media-tools/">Neil Patel</a>, “Over 2.7 billion people are active on social networks, which accounts for approximately 37% of the global population."</span></p>

<p>David J. Bembry had the same idea on Twitter, when he tweeted- “As a business owner it's your job to pay attention to the time and the money you spend for social media graphics and posting tools.
