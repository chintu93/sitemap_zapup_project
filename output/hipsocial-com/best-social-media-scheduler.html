                    <p>The pandemic of 2020 drastically changed the way marketers used their digital channels in reaching out to customers, especially social media.</p>

<p>The use of social media in particular, above other channels of communication like video calling apps, surged and reached an all-time high over the past few months owing to the lockdowns.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1106766/media-consumption-growth-coronavirus-worldwide-by-country/">statistics</a>, since March of last year, there has been a noticeable 21% increase in social media usage</p>

<p>People have been using social media not only to keep in contact with their loved ones, but also to research for products and shop line. Since meeting people and going shopping pretty much became impossible these past few months, companies have also upped their digital sales with attractive discounts and deals offered online. This definitely keeps customer further hooked online, not just in B2C but also B2B.</p>

<p>Social media usage on the whole has been increasing quite rapidly over the past years. With over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/">3.6 Billion people</a> using different platforms in 2020, it has become one of the most popular online activities now, and is expected to reach almost 4.4 Billion by the year 2025.</p>

<p>Whether or not we’ll have to deal with crisis’s by then, we don’t know yet. But one thing we’ve learnt from 2020 is that, no matter the socio-political adversities we face in the physical world, social media usage not only continues, but in fact steps up.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">"<em>The new normal requires every company to put extreme importance on all things digital marketing. While search and email are two major components of digital marketing that can be done in-house, social media is both the most popular activity people do online as well as the most challenging for businesses</em>” - <a href="https://nealschaffer.com/">Neal Schaffer</a></span> </p>

<p>Companies are needless to say brainstorming new ways to engage with customers and convert leads into sales this year, in order to quickly take advantage of the new found surge. Brands are also looking for more efficient ways to offer consistent customer experiences across digital platforms.</p>

<p>And one of the major steps taken by companies is adopting an efficient social media scheduler. It helps companies consistently stay on top of their social media game.</p>

<h2>How best social media schedulers are changing in 2021</h2>

<h3>Organic is the name of the game</h3>

<p>With the number of fake follower generators, spam "like" generators and audience buying services increasing by the day, surprisingly enough, people are getting all the more inclined towards organic growth and organic content.
By all means, organic is the name of the game, as it is the only reliable and solid foundation upon which you can achieve actual growth. User generated content and promotional posts are good too to a certain extent, but in order to establish trust and improve credibility, businesses absolutely need to take the effort to create authentic original and organic content, and generate organic traffic.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30239/71-more-likely-to-purchase-based-on-social-media-referrals-infographic.aspx">recent statistics</a>:</p>

<p>As much as 75% of people don't accept advertisements as completely reliable or as the truth.</p>

<p>Almost 63% of social media users feel that consumer ratings are the number one most helpful contributor to make purchase decisions easier.</p>

<p>And 70% of consumers believe and rely on customer opinions; which happens to be more than double those who trust advertisements. </p>

<p>These numbers make it clear that there are no shortcuts to genuine positive customer experiences, which should be the ultimate goal of every social media marketing campaign</p>

<h3>Content beats everything</h3>

<p>As an extension of the previous point, content is always King. There is nothing that beats or surpasses good quality content on social media. Whether you wish to increase followers, or boost engagement or increase conversions, the first and most important thing you need to do is put out valuable content that users can take advantage of every time. You also need to brainstorm ideas to create unique content – ones that resonate with customers, in order to stay ahead in the competition.
Some of the best social media schedulers like Hipsocial, allow you to create and post content easily across multiple channels. You can ideally create long form posts and break it into shorter shareables to post on different channels.</p>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/best-social-media-scheduler-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="social media scheduling tool" /></p>

<h3>Conversation is a two-way street</h3>

<p>It is all about continuous and prompt customer experiences these days, which necessitates solid conversations. Customers need more transparency and more information to make worthy investments in products and services. Hence, rather than pitching products directly, companies have to offer full blown conversations, as demanded by customers along with insightful content.</p>

<p>The best social media schedulers like Hipsocial offer engagement tools to strike conversations and sustain engagement for the most wholesome customer experiences.</p>

<h3>Attention spans are going down</h3>

<p>Customers are more interested in ultra-short snippets of content these days, as opposed to long form content even in videos. This is probably what led to the raving popularity of Tik Tok videos and Reels on Instagram. These platforms have generated billions of users and followers because of this very feature. 
Clearly, attention spans are going down, and marketers are utilising social media schedulers to post short form content.</p>

<h3>Video continues to dominate</h3>

<p>Video content continues to grow in relevance and popularity. As expected platforms like YouTube facilitating valuable video content is still preferred by customers for important information. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-predictions-2017&amp;hubs_post-cta=Not%20Another%20State%20of%20Marketing%20Report&amp;_ga=2.176624101.1754589130.1609841706-920090788.1604164583 ">HubSpot's Not Another State of Marketing Report</a> further revealed the fact that video was the most commonly used marketing content by companies. It was also the second most engaging type of content on social media.</p>

<p>Hence it is important to use social media tools and schedulers that support the creation of ample video content.</p>

<h3>Live streams gaining popularity</h3>

<p>The live stream features of all social media platforms are unsurprisingly very popular, as it establishes a direct and real time connection with relevant people in companies. This means it is crucial for marketers to make use of these features in the social media platforms that they use to increase engagement and boost growth. Customers simply love an authentic and transparent brand.</p>

<h3>Social listening is the more important than ever</h3>

<p>Social listening has come to be one of the most important tools to have for businesses. It allows marketers to keep up with the conversations that happen in their community, relevant to their business. It also allows them to identify potential markets gaps, using which they can ideate new products and services. It essentially helps them keep a keen eye on likely competition. Hence, it is important for companies to use the best social media schedulers that come with intelligent social listening tools as well, like Hipsocial.</p>

<h3>More channels to improve ROI</h3>

<p>Companies are likely to be using more channels in social media to improve ROI. It definitely makes sense, as any investment in social media is known to generate almost 4 times revenue. It is indeed important to leverage more than one channel and cross post relevant content in different ways across the platforms, as you never know where it will do well.
The best social media schedulers like Hipsocial facilitate the creation and posting of content across multiple channels all at once, making your job a lot easier.</p>

<p>In terms of purchases too, almost 70% of users aged above 55 have apparently bought something online in the past one month, out of which 37% of them plan to continue purchases more frequently in future.</p>

<h3>Data driven engagement boosters</h3>
