                    <p>Social media management tools help you manage your social media planning and execution more 
efficiently. Other benefits include:  </p>

<p><strong>Time savings</strong> - Advanced scheduling across your social media platforms helps you maintain a consistent presence online. Your team can work more efficiently by batch scheduling posts at the most convenient time instead of rushing to publish content during peak times of the day.  </p>

<p><strong>Reputation management</strong> - Social listening within your social media management tool allows your brand to act quickly to respond to negative customer comments, resolving issues quickly before the news spreads.  </p>

<p><strong>Increased brand awareness</strong> - A social media management tool can publish your content across multiple channels at once and during peak publishing times. Your chances of being discovered by your target audience increase significantly.  </p>

<p><strong>Audience insight</strong> - Social media management tools give you deeper insight into your audience. You'll know who's following you, their geographical location, and other relevant demographics, across all of your social networks. Leveraging this data within your overall marketing plan results in more informed marketing decisions.  </p>

<p>Improved customer support - Monitoring and responding to questions from customers and prospects can help streamline their path to purchase. It also leads to increased customer satisfaction rates. Research published in Harvard Business Review shows that customers who receive a response to their inquiries on social media are more likely to remain a customer, spend more money with the brand, and recommend the company to others.  </p>

<p><strong>Faster response times</strong> - Not only is it essential to respond to customers' comments via social media, but it's also important to react quickly. The average customer expects companies to respond to them within one hour on social media. When your organization is juggling multiple social media platforms, this expectation will be difficult to meet. A social media management tool can streamline this process, making it much easier to see your comments and mentions, across all of your networks, from one central location.</p>
