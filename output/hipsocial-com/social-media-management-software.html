<p>There is no shortage of tools on the market that claim to have all the features necessary to run an effective social media campaign.  An effective <a href='social-media-management'>social media management</a> software, however, consists of more than just the bells and whistles that get promoted on a website. What’s more, not all tools are the same, and you can't trust just any old app to take care of your campaigns.</p>

<p>So, with that in mind, how do you figure out which tool will work best for you? You’ve likely already begun your research, and that's probably how you ended up here. Great start!</p>

<p>We’ve compiled a list of tips that will help you choose the best social media management software for your brand’s unique needs. We highly recommend reviewing these tips before pulling the trigger.</p>

<h2><strong>Choosing the Best Social Media Management Software</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Documenting Your Social Media Goals</strong></h3>

<p>Thought precedes action. This means you should put a lot of thought into the goals associated with your social media campaigns. In short, strategy should precede any investment you make into social media management software.</p>

<p>Each campaign should have an overarching goal. Whether you want to expand brand awareness, generate leads, drive website traffic, or increase sales, you should document your goals with clarity.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to think outside the box. Let your creativity guide you to profitable topics and trends like augmented reality or artificial intelligence. </p>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/smms-documenting-your-social-media-goals.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Documenting social media goals" /></p>

<p>Whatever you decide, be sure to document your strategy! A <a href="https://insights.newscred.com/how-to-create-a-documented-content-marketing-strategy/#:~:text=The%20short%20answer%3A%20Having%20a,how%20you'll%20measure%20success.">documented content strategy</a> keeps you and your team focused and even helps measure the success of each campaign.</p>

<h3><strong><a href='social-listening'>social listening</a> Capabilities</strong></h3>

<p>Social listening is often regarded as one of the most important features of social media management software. The ability to determine a brand’s popularity by extracting data from various social media platforms and channels is crucial to the overall success of your campaign.</p>

<p>Make sure the tools you consider have social listening capabilities. This includes the ability to identify when someone mentions you, your brand, or relevant keywords, giving you the opportunity to respond to customers and prospects and even catch trends before they breakout. Not only does this equip you with valuable insight for future campaigns, but it helps you respond to customer concerns promptly, and that's more important now than ever.</p>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/smms-social-listening-capabilities.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Social listening capabilities" /></p>

<h3><strong>High-quality Content Creation</strong></h3>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic">study by Demand Metric</a>, content marketing generates almost three times as many leads as outbound marketing and costs 62% less than traditional marketing methods. That’s why so many organizations focus on high-quality content creation to stay ahead of the pack.</p>

<p>When your social media management software has all the right features, you’ll be able to focus more on creating high-quality content and let the software do the rest. Ensuring your content is solid is still the best way to boost conversions and increase your brand's exposure.</p>

<p>Ann Smarty, CEO of SEOsmarty.com, conveyed the <a href="http://www.seosmarty.com/category/content-marketing/">importance of great content</a>:</p>

<p><strong>"Thanks to the way search engines are now reacting to once tried and true SEO methods, it is getting even harder to strike a balance. Yet there is no getting around the need for good, solid content marketing on a website that expects to turn leads into conversions. Or those that plan on using advanced content to drive brand awareness."</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Analyze Data Across Platforms</strong></h3>

<p>In the marketing world, versatility is key. With the ability to analyze data across multiple platforms, you should be able to gather enough information on industry trends to help expand your brand awareness and create an effective social media strategy.</p>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/smms-analyze-data-across-platforms.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Analyze data across platforms" /></p>

<p>Great social media management software can even help you analyze hashtags and identify the best influencers to help you with content generation and other promotional efforts.</p>

<h3><strong>Pricing</strong></h3>

<p>At the end of the day, it all comes down to value. If you're overpaying for your social media management software, this list of key features and tips should have made it painfully obvious.</p>

<p>While it’s important to invest adequately into your content marketing strategy, which includes social media efforts, it’s also vital to ensure you’re getting the best bang for your buck.</p>

<p>On top of offering good value, many of the more reputable software solutions offer a free trial for anywhere from 14 to 30 days. If your prospective social media management software does not, we recommend finding one that does.</p>

<p>As a bonus tip, make sure that your chosen platform won’t break the bank when your business begins to grow. Not only should your social media management software be able to handle an upscale in productivity, but it should also grow with you without becoming too expensive to add features or users. </p>
