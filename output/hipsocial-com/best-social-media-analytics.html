                    <p>Among small business owners, social media marketing isn’t always top priority. One common misconception is that it’s not vital in the early stages of business growth, and that it becomes increasingly necessary as exposure to the market increases. But, in truth, social media is a driving force of business growth from the very beginning. It’s essential from the earliest of stages, but it’s not easy.</p>

<p>Social media marketing can be complex. It adds tasks to your team’s workflow, and with more processes comes more potential for bottlenecks and problem areas. But it’s important because your audience <em>is</em> on social media, and they’re talking about your brand!</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">The world population has grown to over 7.8 billion, by now, and nearly one in four humans on this planet has a Facebook account,”* <a href="https://neilpatel.com/what-is-social-media-marketing/">says marketing expert Neil Patel</a>.</span></p>

<p>Facebook, quite literally, is beginning to take over the world. 68% of people in North America use the platform, and the percentages for similar countries are equally staggering. In some ways, Facebook is a country of its own. It’s larger than any other country in the world, and one could even argue that it’s more connected.”*</p>

<p>And while Facebook is the largest social media platform, it’s not alone. Over half of the world’s population is active across various social media platforms. Regardless of the industry you’re in or the size of your business, your audience is on social media, and your competition is as well.</p>

<p>In order to compete in any marketplace today, you absolutely must take control of your brand’s image on social media. The audience is there, the competition is there, and the engagements are happening whether you monitor them or not.</p>

<p>Given the sheer size of social media, and given the magnitude of the data collected from various social campaigns, the idea of trying to monitor your brand’s image, keep up with brand mentions, analyze engagements and performance data, and optimize future campaigns based on that data is understandably overwhelming.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/best-social-media-analytics-4.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="social media marketing" /></p>

<p>However, none of this takes away from the necessity of social media marketing.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">If you’re not using social media marketing already,”* says Patel, *”you’ll either have to learn it now or lose in the long run.</span></p>

<p>You can’t compete without a solid social media strategy, and without the best social media analytics tool for your brand. </p>

<h3><strong>Know the Important Features</strong></h3>

<p>Before purchasing the tool, understand what you actually need from the tool. Document your team’s goals and objectives.

<p><img src="/images/blog/best-social-media-analytics-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Know the Important Features" /></p>

<p>What kind of reports do you need? How frequently does your team require updates on social campaign performance? Finally, what do you need to know about your customers so that you can make personalized content that speaks to them? </p>

<h3><strong>Analyze Social Media Trends</strong></h3>

<p>The tool should be able to analyze online mentions of your business on social media. That means that it is listening to any post that mentions your brand or a branded hashtag as these posts can signal important changes and trends related to both your followers and the effectiveness of your business online. </p>

<p>The best social media analytics tools enable you to analyze <em>people</em> who have shown interest in your brand, products, or services. Advanced reporting should be top priority for brands of any size and in any industry. This information will tell you who to target and make it easier to create targeted content that engages your audience. </p>

<p>Finally, reports should display how your business is trending—not simply how many likes you received. By this, we mean that it should show what is trending around your business as well as what users are interested in.</p>

<h3><strong>Set Social Media Goals</strong></h3>

It should allow you to define specific KPI’s and measure the results of your efforts to ensure success. The best social media analytics software will allow you to collect and store data and give you functions that allow you to filter and search through that data with ease.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>Another common mistake in the world of marketing software is to ignore free trials. While there are multiple reasons a brand may offer a free trial, it’s important that you exhaust every feature and function of the prospective analysis software prior to investing in it. Ensure that your team has ample access to the software and be sure to get feedback from them.</p>
