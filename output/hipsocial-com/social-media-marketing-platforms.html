                    <p>Since its inception around the year 1996, social media as a whole phenomenon has influenced customers greatly. It is currently being used by more than half of the entire population of the world and its user base has almost tripled in amount over the last decade passing <a href="https://backlinko.com/social-media-users">3.8 Billion users</a> as of 2020. And needless to say, these numbers are only slated to increase over the coming years.</p>

<p>Considering the usage of social media over the past few years, the growth rate is around 12.5% in a year, more so since 2015.</p>

<p>And it is this increasingly inclined social media usage trend that led to the emergence of the concepts of social selling and social CRM in business. As more and more of customers started spending time on social media channels, companies felt the need to target customers through the very channels that they are most active in.</p>

<h2>A major shift in focus</h2>

<p>The emergence of interesting, fun and convenient social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter led to the significant shift of customer attention from mass media to social networking sites.</p>

<p>Back in the day, companies used to target customers with creative advertisements on TV and print media, where a direct selling approach was used to target customers. Of course it used to effective to a great extent given the lack of means for customers to actually connect with the people behind the brands that they liked.</p>

<p>However, as social media gained mass popularity, and as people began spending more time on their favourite channels, it necessitated a major shift in focus from one-way advertisement channels to social networking for effective lead generation. It led to a space where conversations happened between customers and brands – selling was no longer a one way street and advertisements stopped being radio made. </p>

<p>As we look at social media today, customers have the window to communicate with brands and voice their take on new product adverts, making selling a two-way street.</p>

<p>This is what inevitably led to the rise of social selling as a concept where companies make use of social media to create content and promote their products to induce customers to purchase. Naturally, it involves more of open conversations and transparent ways.</p>

<p>With the increase in use of social media channels where features like DMs and live videos enable customers to directly get in touch with the human faces of brands, customers have grown to be more intelligent, careful and particular about the companies they work with.</p>

<p>This was probably what led companies to rethink their entire approach with selling, as direct product pitches completely stopped working.</p>

<p>This in turn led to the emergence of social CRM, and a whole marketing concept revolving around taking care of the precious relationship with customers.</p>

<p>It is always a combination of a good social CRM strategy and a good social media marketing campaign along with the right tools that facilitate successful social selling.</p>

<h2>The need for an efficient social media marketing platform</h2>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/social-media-marketing-platforms-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="social media marketing platforms" /></p>

<p>Statistics suggest that the average social media user holds 8.6 social media accounts.</p>

<p>This means that the average person is consuming content including product reviews, product info and company info from up to 8 platforms throughout social media channels.</p>

<p>This fuels the need for businesses to be active across all of the commonly used channels according to their own user demographics in order to make the biggest impact.</p>

<p>And it would be impossible to handle content and users on all channels manually unless large social media teams are recruited, which is not a feasible or cost effective option at all.</p>

<p>For the same reason, companies resort to multi-functional social media marketing platforms to augment their social media efforts. By doing so, marketers not only get to create and post content across a number of platforms and be active on all at the same time, they also get to take full advantage of their social media presence, by using other tools like social listening and analytics. </p>

<p>Some of the best social media marketing platforms offer seamless integrations with all popular social media channels, which let you listen in on conversations happening in every place associated with your industry. On top of that, they offer insightful analytics and reports on how you fared in your social media campaigns, so that you can identify anomalies and make improvements as you go.</p>

<p>For example, Hipsocial is one of the most efficient and feature-rich social media marketing platforms in the market today, offering well-designed social posting and scheduling features, with which you can create and post content across several platforms all at once. Interestingly it also offers a unique time zone selection feature, with which you can choose time zones to post content across multiple countries to generate the most engagement.</p>
