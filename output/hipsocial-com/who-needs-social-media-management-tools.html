                    <p>Anyone who conducts business should have a social media presence. Why? Studies show that 95% of online adults aged 18-34 are likely to follow a brand via social media. Additionally, 75% of B2B buyers and 84% of C-level executives use social media to make purchasing decisions.  </p>

<p>Now that we've established why you should have a presence on social media, let's discuss how many social networks you should actively engage with.  </p>

<p>On average, people have 5.54 social media accounts, and brands, depending on the size, are typically active on 2 to 10 different channels. Social media experts agree that you shouldn't spread yourself too thin. It's better to have a strong presence on fewer channels than to have an inactive profile on many. The latter dilutes your brand recognition.  </p>

<p>However, it's important to consider that your competitors may be hogging the lion's share of attention on social media platforms that your company isn't active on. By using a social media management tool, your organization can be in several places at once, engaging with customers and prospects in less time.  </p>

<p>Managing any number of channels both effectively and efficiently is challenging without the use of a social media management tool. Therefore, any individual or company belonging to two or more social networks can benefit from using a social media management tool.  </p>

<p>So, who needs social media management tools? The simple answer of the question is everyone that's hoping to enhance social media presence and improve social media marketing game.</p>

<p>A social media management tool helps easily manage all your social media needs like planing, postig, scheduling, monitoring.</p>
