Let¬¥s start with the last one on the list.</p>

<h2>15 Social Media Monitoring Tools for 2021</h2>

<h3>15. Cyfe</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.cyfe.com/">Cyfe</a> is an all-in-one online business dashboard app that helps you easily monitor and analyze all of your business data in one, organized place. With Cyfe, you'll be able to connect and pull data from your advertising, email, monitoring, sales, finance, SEO, social media, support, and web analytics accounts.

Cyfe helps you make better business decisions by bringing all of your business data into a single and highly-organized view, and saves you a ton of time by eliminating the need to manually log into, analyze, and report out data from multiple services each and every day.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>We loved its excellent implementation of web analytics, since it made it much easier to create value strategies for social media. There is not much that we dislike of Cyfe. Yes, we would like certain things to perfection, but nothing is perfect. One thing we would like is more integrations. Additionally, SEO tools do not provide adequate web positioning and the panel is not very customizable</p>

<h3>14. Unamo</h3>

<p><a href="https://unamo.com/">Unamo</a> Social Media Monitoring allows you to track all social media interactions related to your brand, product, or topic of interest. By analyzing and drawing conclusions from the data, you can make your marketing strategy more successful.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>The tool has a very clean design and is very easy to handle. It has a significant amount of options and functionalities that ease up your work. The only downside, besides some foreign language remnants that still have to be localized, is the keyword grouping feature that could be much better. All in all, a good tool but it still requires some work to get a better place on our list.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>It's a great way to build engagement by communicating to start a discussion or just say thank you, it has a quick look capability that provides a quick snapshot of everything that happens with social media profiles, a very lightweight platform to set up and manage. Downsides are its complicated user interface and lack of support for some channels.</p>

<h3>12. Qwaya</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.qwaya.com/">Qwaya</a> is a self-service Facebook advertising tool for marketers, e-commerce companies and agencies, with Google analytics integration, team collaboration, campaign management and scheduling capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>If you‚Äôre the type of business that relies on social media to market your products and/or service, which most of the businesses today are, then you could really use a social media software solution like Qwaya.</p>

<h3>11. Synthesio</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.synthesio.com/">Synthesio</a>, an Ipsos technology company, is a global Leader in the latest report on Social Listening Platforms published by an independent research firm.

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>This tool offers excellent analysis, the ability to update the graphics is surprising, it is very easy to use and offers a very intuitive user interface, we also liked the breadth of information it provided us with. The only downside is that it is built for enterprises and not SMBs.</p>

<h3>10. Brandwatch</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/">Brandwatch</a> is the world‚Äôs pioneering digital consumer intelligence suite, helping over 2,000 of the world‚Äôs most admired brands and agencies including Unilever, Walmart and Dell to make insightful, data-driven business decisions. The company underwent the industry-transforming merger with Crimson Hexagon in 2018, and has made three acquisitions to date: PeerIndex (2013), BuzzSumo (2017) as a standalone content marketing platform, and Qriously (2019) to add global survey capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>Brandwatch Analytics is a great social media analytics choice for digital marketing professionals employed by mostly larger businesses and enterprises. It does a good job ticking off the boxes that small to midsized businesses are looking for in a social media analytics solution. While it can get a little expensive compared to the competition, the platform's robust analytics make it well worth a look.</p>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/social-media-monitoring-tools-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="social monitoring tools" /></p>

<h3>9. If This Then That (IFTTT)</h3>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> is the world‚Äôs leading connectivity platform. They help over 700 global enterprises accelerate the digital transformation of their products into integrated services, dramatically reducing their development costs while extending compatibility and lifetime value. </p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>IFTTT is very capable and highly accessible. If you want two disparate apps, IoT devices, or services to communicate with each other, IFTTT likely offers some sort of solution. Our main concern is that the latest updates to the web and mobile apps sacrifice some usability for a cleaner design.</p>

<h3>8. Zoho Social</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.zoho.com/social/">Zoho Social</a> is a complete social media management platform for businesses &amp; agencies. It helps you schedule posts, monitor mentions, create custom dashboards, and more. Zoho Social is from Zoho.com‚Äîa suite of 40+ products trusted by over 40 Million users.

The monitoring capabilities help you track relevant social conversations and respond to what matters.

If you‚Äôre managing a team, Zoho Social‚Äôs collaboration features and custom user-roles make it easy for you to bring all the members on board to manage social accounts for multiple brands.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>Zoho is a powerful solution for social media managers, small and medium businesses, and agencies managing social media and brands. Its versatile scheduling and publishing features combined with its solid analytics and social media listening capabilities make it a worthy choice. However, the downsides are its lack of support for less popular social networks and poor analytics and reporting.</p>

<h3>7. HubSpot Marketing</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot Marketing</a> is a leading growth platform. Since 2006, they have been on a mission to make the world more inbound. Today, over 68,800 total customers in more than 100 countries use HubSpot‚Äôs award-winning software, services, and support to transform the way they attract, engage, and delight customers. Comprised of Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub, and a powerful free CRM, HubSpot gives companies the tools they need to Grow Better.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>HubSpot Marketing, which starts at $50 per month, is an excellent all-around marketing automation subscription service that happens to integrate a variety of CRM, email marketing, and sales solutions. Considered by many to be a pioneering product in its category, it can fulfill the needs of small to midsize businesses (SMB) looking to solidify their marketing solution core. However, its main downside is that it is very expensive. Coupled with a steep learning curve and SEO features that could be improved, HubSpot is good but there are better social media marketing tools for less money.</p>

<h3>6. Agorapulse</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.agorapulse.com/">Agorapulse</a> is a social media management platform that enables agencies, businesses and marketers to manage all their social media messages, schedule and publish content, identify key influencers, monitor social channels, and get stunning reports all in one easy-to-use dashboard.

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>It is an easy tool to administer in all the different social media, it provides you with a magnificent automation of the workflow, the content scheduling to publish on social networks works very well, it also offers a detailed report that helps you increase productivity. Downsides include very bad mobile version and tons of unnecessary email notifications. </p>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/social-media-monitoring-tools-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="social monitoring software" /></p>

<h3>5. Sprout Social</h3>

<p><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/">Sprout Social</a> is one of the first and most venerable social media management and analytics solutions in the industry. Having landed a $40.5 million round of Series D funding in December 2018, it has continued to add functionality for small to midsize businesses (SMBs). Starting at $99 per user per month for the Standard plan, Sprout Social offers a good balance of social media management and analytics.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>The UI, social networks it supports, and its detailed analytics provide plenty of fodder for SMBs to gain insight from and begin to build a social program on. Downside is the price which can get pretty expensive in case of multiple users.</p>

<h3>4. Buffer</h3>

<p><a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> is an intuitive, streamlined social media management platform trusted by brands, businesses, agencies, and individuals to help drive meaningful engagement and results on social media. It has a suite of products for publishing, engagement, analytics, and team collaboration (Publish, Reply, and Analyze). Buffer products are carefully considered and highly refined in order to help social media marketers and teams work more efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>Buffer is a great package of social media management tools that rocks a great design and is very consistent with it's support and improvements over time. It also helps a lot that it's cheaper compared to other competitors in some ways. The price gives it a competitive advantage. Reauthorization of social accounts is time-consuming and the tool can get pretty expensive when you add multiple team members.</p>

<h3>3. Talkwalker</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.talkwalker.com/">Talkwater</a> is a social listening and analytics company that empowers over 2,000 brands and agencies to optimize the impact of their communication efforts. We provide companies with an easy-to-use platform to protect, measure, and promote their brands worldwide, across all communication channels.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>Talkwalker isn't the solution to consider if your business needs social media publishing and scheduling features. From a social monitoring perspective, Talkwalker packs fairly in-depth analytics features when it comes to brand listening and influencer monitoring, hashtag and campaign tracking, crisis management, competitor analysis, and advanced metrics across social channels. Same as a lot of other providers on this list, Talkwater is pricey. </p>

<h3>2. Hootsuite</h3>

<p><a href="https://hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite</a> is the most widely used social media management platform, used by over 18 million people worldwide and trusted by more than 800 of the Fortune 1000. Their brand promise is to empower all organizations‚Äìlarge and small‚Äìto strategically grow their brand, business and customer relationships with social. Hootsuite¬¥s platform brings together your social networks and integrates with over 200 business applications. It‚Äôs the one place to build customer relationships, listen to the needs of the market and grow your revenue. From social advertising to employee advocacy, Hootsuite is an all-in-one solution for driving business results.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>Hootsuite (which begins at $29 per month, billed annually) is one of the more mature and comprehensive offerings in the social media management market. Capable of automating post scheduling and grabbing key performance metrics, it also does a decent job of pulling analytics data. Getting up and running with Hootsuite is quick and the tool stands out among other social media management tools with ample analytics capabilities. However, it¬¥s expensive and all of the most powerful features are reserved for enterprise edition which is even more expensive for most SMBs.</p>

<h3>1. HipSocial</h3>

<p><a href="https://hipsocial.com/">HipSocial</a> HipSocial helps growing businesses seamlessly manage multiple accounts, monitor key trends and conversations, increase engagement and generate leads, stay organized and more‚Äîall at just $10/user/month. </p>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/social-media-management-screenshot-1.webp" alt="Hipsocial" />
With its intuitive features and budget-friendly price point, HipSocial is a strong entrant to the social media management software industry, which has players like Hootsuite, Salesforce, Buffer, Sprout Social, Agorapulse, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Our opinion:</strong> </p>

<p>The best part about this tool is that it allows you to save time and stay consistent by writing and scheduling weeks worth of social media posts across channels with advanced scheduling. With HipSocial‚Äôs Smart Finder, you can discover and engage with prospects, influencers, and other key people to build new relationships and expand visibility. You can make informed decisions with advanced dashboards and in-depth analytics. With tracked URLs and engagement statistics, brands can know what content is working and what isn‚Äôt as well as bring in more efficiency by coupling their personal touch with selective, controlled automation‚Äîvia a free downloadable Chrome extension.</p>
