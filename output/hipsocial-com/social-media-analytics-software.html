                    <p>Social media marketing has exploded in recent years. With the kinds of advancements we’ve seen in social media, it’s no surprise that small businesses and Fortune 500 brands alike all depend on social media to drive exposure and sales.</p>

<p><em>”It’s no secret,”</em> says social media expert and entrepreneur Jeff Bullas, <em>”social media marketing isn’t as straightforward as it used to be and consumers are getting more socially savvy by the moment. Today’s consumer no longer just hopes, but expects their favorite brands to continue to offer them new and innovative ways to engage socially.</em>”</p>

<p>Despite the growing numbers of brands investing in a social presence, many owners and managers have very little experience when it comes to creating campaigns and analyzing data. Social media analytics software helps these businessmen and women take control of their brand’s online image.</p>

<p>To understand what social media analytics software can do for you, let’s take a look at what it is. Techopedia defines <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13853/social-media-analytics-sma">social media analytics</a> as <em>”collecting data from social media sites and blogs and evaluating that data to make business decisions.”</em></p>

<p>This type of software can be very valuable and beneficial to brands of all shapes and sizes. But not all of these tools are created equal. In fact, there’s almost as many options on the market as there are industries that use them. In order to figure out which one is best for your business, we’ve compiled the top 15 choices in social media analytics software, according to our experts.</p>
