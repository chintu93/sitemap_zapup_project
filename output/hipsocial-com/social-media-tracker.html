                    <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Social networks have given companies one of the best opportunities ever for connecting with their customers and potential customers. And while there are many social networks that are equipped with a wide array of tools that you can use to present your offering to your audience, it´s imperative that you notice that being present on these networks doesn’t guarantee your audience will notice it.</p>

<p>Social media is a marketplace. And as every other market, it´s crowded. It´s competitive. It´s chaotic. This means that you constantly need to track your results and test and adapt your social media strategy based on customer analytics. According to Boston Consulting Group, “data-driven marketers can identify the value of each touch point with consumers along the purchasing journey to inform KPIs and link these engagements to business outcomes such as sales and profit impact. These marketers know what their customers are thinking about, where they stand on the purchasing journey, and why they buy what they buy.”</p>

<p>The aforementioned wide array of social media trackers is both a blessing and a curse, so in this blog post we will try to explain why having a social media tracker is a must and how can you select the best one out of so many different options.
Let´s begin.</p>

<h1>Why You Need to Use a Social Media Tracker</h1>

<p>With so many social tracking metrics, it can be difficult to identify which are the exact metrics you should follow. Tracking on social media channels is not an easy job if you don’t have a social media tracker.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;The bigger crisis is our truths. Truths that social media has exposed to be so weak, that blatant lies can look just as strong.&quot; - <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisKutarna?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ChrisKutarna</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TEDatBCG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TEDatBCG</a> <a href="https://t.co/4rWwR0aYPx">pic.twitter.com/4rWwR0aYPx</a></p>&mdash; Boston Consulting Group (@BCG) <a href="https://twitter.com/BCG/status/1176458961450520576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
Metrics gained from proper tracking give you insights into which platforms are most effective to reach your customers. If, for instance, you are generating significantly more leads from Facebook rather than Twitter, you should allocate more resources and content accordingly.</p>

<p>Here are just few examples of social media metrics that any digital marketer should track and why.</p>

<h2>Page Growth Analytics Will Boost Your Performance</h2>

<p>Social networks are one of the most powerful tools in every marketer´s toolbox. But sometimes, even navigating through this complex and often confusing terrain of posts, videos, blog posts and memes can be challenging. How do you know which type of content is the best one for you? And how do you know if the content you post is even being noticed by your audience?</p>

<p>The actual page growth is a metric that tracks nothing more than the growth of the number of followers on your social media profile. Although it can seem like a simple metric that does not have any crucial effect on one´s marketing strategy, it is actually a powerful metric that is often used as a milestone for goal-oriented strategies.</p>

<p>One good example on how this metric can be used is competitor analysis. If you notice that one of your competitors is rapidly increasing their number of followers, it might mean that they are doing something right and that you can learn from their social media marketing strategy. Additionally, having a timeline of your number of followers will allow you to pinpoint specific moments in your marketing strategy that had the most positive impact on your social media growth.</p>

<h2>Engagement Rate Helps You Have the Right Amount of Posts</h2>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/social-media-tracker-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="calculate your engagement rate" /></p>

<p>Engagement rate is a metric that tracks how much your audience interacts (engages) with your content. The part of your audience that engages with your content does that through likes, comments and social network sharing. This metric is often used when analyzing how effective one´s marketing campaign is because people who spend time interacting with your content are more likely to convert into customers.</p>

<p>You can calculate your engagement rate by using the total number of engagements on a specific post and divide it by the total number of followers on your account. Typically, engagement rate is shown in a form of a percentage. Here is a formula you can use to calculate your engagement rate:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hopperhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Your-Ideas-768x173.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The only “problem” with engagement rate is calculating it. The reason for that is that the definition of an engaged customer differs based on the social network since different networks have different types of interactions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Website: scroll depth, time on page, page views, bounce rate, filled forms, shares etc.</li>
<li>Facebook: clicks, reactions, comments and shares</li>
<li>Instagram: likes and comments.</li>
<li>Twitter: comments, likes, retweets.</li>
<li>Pinterest: comments, likes and pins.</li>
<li>LinkedIn: impressions, new followers acquired, reactions, clicks and comments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since most social media marketing campaigns involve multiple social media networks, engagement rate needs to be measured across each channel.</p>

<p>Although there is some controversy around which social media metrics are most important when it comes to marketing, engagement rate is, in most cases, at the top of the list. The reason for that is that engagement rate helps you determine how much content you should post on which social media network and how much should you post within a certain time period.</p>

<p>Based on our experience, each marketer has its own way of looking at it and its importance, they all use engagement rate to adapt the quality and quantity of posts for their social media campaigns. The easiest way of doing this is with the help of social media tracker tool such as HipSocial. Giving you instant information on the total performance of your content across different channels, you can easily adapt the number and quality of your posts to improve the overall result of your marketing campaign.</p>

<h2>Social Listening Can Help You Stay Ahead</h2>

<p>Social listening is a process that consists of monitoring all relevant social media networks for mentions of your company´s name, competitors´ names, your products or services names and much more. Social listening is when you track these networks for everything that you find relevant to your company with the goal of analyzing or addressing them to find new insights and uncovering new opportunities.</p>

<p>The actual process consists of two steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>First step:</strong> monitoring social media networks for mentions of your company, competitor companies, products and everything else related to your business</li>
<li><strong>Second step:</strong> analyzing the collected information and putting it to action. For example, this can range from replying to a customer to finding reasons for shifting your whole brand strategy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you take action in regards to the collected data, the process is started. And unlike social media monitoring where you look at metrics such as engagement rate and page growth we discussed above, social listening goes beyond numbers by taking into account the context of the collected data. This makes it easier for you to understand how people feel about you and how they feel about your competition. Keeping an eye on this online mood is called social media sentiment and is a key part of social media listening.</p>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/social-media-tracker-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="social listening" /></p>

<p>Being able to understand how your audience feels about your company will help you keep your product and marketing strategy on the right track. It will also help you respond immediately to all positive and negative comments related to your brand. To put it simply, if you don’t use social media listening, you are leaving a significant opportunity on the table.</p>

<p>Your customers are the ones telling you what they need and what they expect from your brand. By actively listening what they are saying, you are showing them that you are one of those companies that actually care. And that makes the difference for both of you. </p>

<p>Here are just some ways how social listening, such as the one HipSocial can provide you with, can help your company:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can engage with your customers more easily.</li>
<li>You can manage negative PR immediately.</li>
<li>You can track your competitors and their every move.</li>
<li>You can identify pain points by listening to your customers´ feedback.</li>
<li>You can identify new sales opportunities. </li>
<li>You can identify new influencers and brand advocates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing the Right Social Media Tracker Tool</h2>

<p>The right social media tracker can help you optimize your time and help you get the maximum results from your social media marketing efforts. However, with so many different tools to choose from, finding the right one can be difficult.</p>

<p>The rise of social media marketing has resulted in a wide array of different productivity applications and tools, all of which have different sets of features and benefits. This growing array of available tools has made it difficult to determine which one is the right one for you. So, how exactly do you pick the best social media tracker for your needs?</p>

<p><img src="https://hipsocial.com/images/blog/social-media-tracker-4.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="social media tracker tool" /></p>

<p>In this chapter, we will go through several key factors you need to keep in mind in order to make the right choice. </p>

<ul>
<li>Start by determining your most important requirements.</li>
<li>Determine your spending budget.</li>
<li>Investigate the type of setup and customer support that the tool provides.</li>
<li>Research what each tool´s unique selling propositions are.</li>
<li>Check the business model and contract details.</li>
<li>Test each tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>After narrowing your choices, it is time to select the best one because apart from the resources you will invest in using the tool, you will want to reap the benefits that social media tracker offers.
Picking the right social media tracker will give you the ability to connect better with your target audience and convert them into customers.</p>
