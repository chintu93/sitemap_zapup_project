                    <p>Social media analytics is an integral part of a successful social media strategy. Social media analytics tools simplify an otherwise tedious and tiresome process of collecting invaluable data. This data is collected from various social media sites and helps you learn more about your users and their behavior. This data also helps you boost brand exposure and <a href="https://bulk.ly/grow-email-list-with-social-media/">grow your email list.</a>.</p>

<p>Social media not only helps you identify leads and demographics, but it also helps you nurture existing customers or clients, expanding your reach and boosting your brand simultaneously. And every relationship you make on social media leads to word-of-mouth possibilities, boosting your brand exposure even more.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">Alexandra Tachalova, digital marketing wiz and Founder of Digital Olympus, explained the importance of social media efforts, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/local-seo/social-media-marketing-local-businesses/#close">saying that</a> "neglecting to incorporate social media into your marketing plan can cost you – not just in terms of new potential customers who don’t know you (and who your competitor is happy to collect!) but also in terms of retaining your existing customers."</span></p>

<p>Social media allows business owners and decision-makers to plug into an enormous network of billions of potential customers or clients. Marketing expert Neil Patel commented on the sheer size of one of the largest social media platforms on the planet.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">"Since opening up for everyone to sign up on September 26, 2006, Facebook now has 1.6 billion users, said Patel. The world population has grown to over 7.8 billion, by now, and nearly one in four humans on this planet has a Facebook account. Facebook, quite literally, is beginning to take over the world. 68% of people in North America use the platform, and the percentages for similar countries are equally staggering."</span></p>

<p>If you want to compete in this new digital era, there’s no way around it: you need a solid social media strategy or you won’t last long.</p>
