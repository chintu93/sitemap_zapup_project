                    <p>In 2004, an obscure sophomore launched a social media website designed to keep his fellow Harvard classmates connected. It was impossible for Mark Zuckerberg to foresee the impact his innovative website would have on the world.</p>

<p>Today, <em>The Facebook,</em> as it was called back then, is used by BILLIONS of people worldwide. And it’s just <em>one</em> of a growing number of social media sites that keep our world connected.</p>

<p>Over half the world’s population is active across numerous social media platforms. When we talk about social media, what generally comes to mind are the big names; the seven platforms most commonly used by people and businesses. </p>

<p><strong>The <em>”Big Seven”</em> Social Media Platforms are:</strong>
* Facebook
* Instagram
* LinkedIn
* Twitter
* Pinterest
* Snapchat
* Reddit</p>

<p>In truth, however, there are hundreds of social media platforms -- some you’re probably familiar with, like YouTube, and others that may not be on your radar yet, like Triller, Valence, and Untapped.</p>

<p>When it comes to promoting your brand on social media, it’s obviously important to focus much of your efforts on the big seven platforms (or eight, if you include YouTube). However, as any good marketer will tell you, trends are important, too. </p>

<p>There are <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/social-media-sites/">hundreds of social media sites</a> that are growing in popularity and that should be considered as potentially valuable platforms to reach your specific audience.</p>

<p>With such humble beginnings, social media’s growth in popularity <em>and</em> versatility is stunning. What started as a simple means of communication between friends and family has grown into an invaluable tool for positive change and brand management.</p>

<h2>Solid Social Strategy</h2>

<p>Today, <a href="https://review42.com/social-media-marketing-statistics/#:~:text=At%20least%2091%25%20of%20US,social%20media%20for%20marketing%20purposes">over 90% of businesses</a> in the United States use social media to connect with their core demographics. Given the incredible usage statistics, it’s no wonder that so many businesses use social media as a viable channel for marketing and sales. With billions of active users, it’s safe to assume a big chunk of your intended audience is online.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/tools-to-measure-social-media-engagement-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Solid Social Strategy" /></p>

<p>However, just because a brand is active on social media doesn’t mean it’s <em>benefiting</em> from social media. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn provide a powerful means of brand management, and while that power can be used to positively transform a brand’s image online, it can just as easily produce negative effects.</p>

<h2>Engagement on Social Media</h2>

<p>In order to achieve more engagement from your social campaigns, you need to take an audit of your strategy and identify weaknesses and problem areas that end up holding you back. Along with taking advantage of tools to measure social media engagement, by implementing the following intel into your brand’s social media campaigns, you’ll see a clear jump in the level of engagement you receive. What’s more, the following points will also enhance your efforts in other areas of marketing, as well!</p>

<p>To discuss social media engagement is to discuss social media <em>strategy.</em> And at the end of the day, the level of engagement you receive from each campaign will be directly correlated to the level of effort and knowledge you’ve put into your strategy.</p>

<p>And so, to help you make the most of your social media efforts and boost your engagement online, our experts at HipSocial have compiled a list of 7 crucial elements of a successful social media strategy.</p>

<h2>Seven Expert Tips to More Social Media Engagement</h2>

<h3>Conduct Audience Research</h3>

<p>This includes primary, secondary, qualitative, and quantitative research that revolves around your intended audience. The <a href="https://communicationmgmt.usc.edu/blog/4-research-methods-for-audience-analysis/">audience research methods</a> you use will depend on your goals for the research, and might include interviews, focus groups, social media monitoring, surveys, and data analysis.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/tools-to-measure-social-media-engagement-4.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Conduct Audience Research" /></p>

<h3>Goals &amp; Objectives</h3>

<p>Though often used interchangeably, <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/8-pub207_60743_7.pdf">goals and objectives are not the same</a>. In short, objectives are the tasks that must be done to achieve an overarching goal. Each campaign you run should have at least one unique <a href="https://buffer.com/library/social-media-goals/">social media goal</a>, and you’ll need to identify various tasks that must be done to reach that goal.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/tools-to-measure-social-media-engagement-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Goals &amp; Objectives" /></p>

<h3>Schedules</h3>

<p>In the realm of social media, timing is crucial. Schedules help you and your team better connect with your intended audience. Data from previous campaigns, as well as secondary data available online and in marketing publications can reveal the best times for you to run campaigns on various platforms. Additionally, there’s a wealth of data available online that covers the best times to post on various platforms. </p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white"><em>”Knowing when to post on every social platform is one important way to stay a step ahead and make sense of the content overload that seems to be occurring on many channels. Whether you want to use this data to find out the peak times to get more interactions with your campaigns, or you want to capitalize on quieter hours on social networks, you can align these insights with your own social media publishing calendar and start planning your posts with greater purpose.”</em> (<a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/">Sprout Social</a>)</span></p>

<h3>KPIs</h3>

<p>Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, are variables of campaign performance that you’ll want to monitor closely to get an idea of how your campaigns are performing. The specific <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-kpis/">KPIs you’ll want to monitor</a> for a given campaign will depend on your overarching goal(s) for that campaign. As you can see, properly identifying goals and objectives is crucial to the success of your marketing efforts.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/tools-to-measure-social-media-engagement-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="KPIs" /></p>

<h3>Consistency</h3>

<p>In terms of boosting engagement, consistency involves the <em>frequency with which you post, the time of day you generally post, and the voice or image you convey about your brand with each post.</em> Although it’s often overlooked, a consistent <em>brand voice</em>, as it’s called, is equally important as all the other elements of your social strategy. Ensure your voice is consistent across all social platforms.</p>

<h3>Data Analysis</h3>

<p>Being able to <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-optimization/">optimize social campaigns</a> is essential to success in social media. It’s likely that you and your team will learn lessons as you monitor the performance of your social campaigns. It’s crucial that you collect all the relevant data required to make both ongoing and future adjustments and optimizations. Properly optimizing future campaigns based on lessons learned from past campaigns is the only way to truly succeed in the long run.</p>
