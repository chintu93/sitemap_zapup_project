                    <p>Social listening software is very effective at helping your brand stay up-to-date on mentions and engagements relevant to your company, your products, your competitors, and your industry in general. By utilizing social listening, you're able to monitor and track keywords and hashtags that are relevant to your industry or niche.</p>

<p>As a concept, social listening is vital to the success of your brand. It takes customer service to the next level and gives you a direct line of communication with customers and prospects.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">“The fact of the matter is that prospects, leads, and customers are actively talking about you, your brand, and your industry on the social web says Ryan Deiss, entrepreneur, investor, and author of numerous best-sellers on digital marketing and business. <em>“If companies are not actively listening for these conversations, someone may as well have installed a telephone in your customer care department that is ringing off the hook with no one picking up the phone.”</em>,”</span></p>

<p>Once you notice relevant mentions, you can quickly and easily respond to issues, comments, or compliments. This is especially important in terms of customer support. Not only do users get a timely response, but that responsiveness is seen by any followers who happen to view the engagement.</p>

<p>The market is flush with apps that come in all shapes and sizes. This makes it tricky to choose the best social listening software for your unique needs. But, when it comes to a successful social media strategy, it’s crucial to find a tool that works well with your brand.</p>
