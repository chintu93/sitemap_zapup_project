                    <p>Business Process Management (BPM) is defined by Gartner as a discipline that involves methods to discover, model, analyze, measure, improve, and optimize business processes. In order to do effective BPM, you need the right strategy, the right team, and the right tools. </p>

<p>We’ve gathered the list of the top BPM solutions to consider if you are interested in improving processes through BPM. But, first, we’ll take a closer look at what BPM is and the features of BPM solutions available on the market.</p>

<h2><strong>A Closer Look at Business Process Management</strong></h2>

<p>Businesses need processes to operate everything they do. Different departments have to perform their own processes for the organization. Each need to take data and transform it to perform whatever processes they need to and either complete them or move them to another department.</p>

<p><img src="https://bpmapp.com/images/blog/a-closer-look-at-business-process-management.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="A Closer Look at Business Process Management" /></p>

<p>BPM enables organizations to discover those core processes (and not-so-core ones) and model, analyze, measure, and improve them in order to automate and optimize them. There are several factors that go into successfully implementing business process management, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Know your goals before beginning BPM</li>
<li>Obtain buy-in from all stakeholders and users</li>
<li>Consider BPM to be a whole new mindset, not just a project</li>
<li>Find the right software to ensure successful BPM implementation</li>
</ul>

<p>The processes that can be designed and improved by BPM are nearly endless. However, to give you an idea of some of the processes numerous organizations find BPM to be beneficial for, here are some examples:
- Account management
- Expense reports
- Employee onboarding
- Customer service requests
- Invoice management
- Compliance processes
- Project management
- And so many more</p>

<p>Of course, in order to find the right software solution, you’ll want to do you research into the best possible tools on the market. Fortunately, we’ve started this research for you by putting together this list of the top 5 business process management solutions to choose from.</p>
