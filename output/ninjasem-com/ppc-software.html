                    <p>It is the 21st century, and innovation is a gift that keeps giving. It comes as no surprise that as each year passes, there is a sort of evolution that arises, this evolution scoffs at stagnation, and if you do not want to be left behind, you must scoff at it too. This is why no sector has been left behind in this quest for innovation and novelty. The advertisement sector can boast of leading the other sectors, as there is never time to slow down. One of these significant innovations was, of course, the advent of pay-per-click (PPC) advertising. </p>

<p>PPC is a type of advertising on the internet in which advertisers are charged each time a user taps on one of their advertisements. Many of these searches result in pay-per-click advertisements. Businesses that run promotions in pay-per-click advertising are only paid when users click on their ad, thus the term "pay-per-click."</p>

<p>Pay-per-click (PPC) advertisement is needed to get your online business off the ground in 2021. It isn't even a discussion. With most of the populations constant daily activity tied to their mobile devices, it is paramount that marketers and business owners alike seize this opportunity, as though it has been served on a platter of gold. With PPC Software, users can realise a maximum profit on money invested and enjoy improved site traffic and interactions. Points that might not have been possible with alternative means of advertising.</p>

<p>So now that you have a general idea of what PPC is and how it works, the next step for you should be getting your PPC software and preparing to give your business a much-needed energy boost. But the question is, "What are the features to look for in PPC Software?". Well, if you asked this question, then the great news is that this post has all your answers. </p>

<h2>TOP FEATURES OF PPC SOFTWARE</h2>

<h4>Campaign management:</h4>

<p>Manage the entire campaign preparation and execution process, including keyword grouping and selection, budgeting, bidding, and keyword updates. Campaign management automation facilitates the launch, scheduling, fast planning, and tracking of marketing campaigns across multiple platforms, reducing lead time. It used to take a few weeks to prepare and then conduct a marketing campaign. Multiple pushes to potential buyers (referred to as prospects) are usually made via email, social media, surveys, print materials, giveaways, and other methods and channels.This feature aids in the understanding of your clients, allowing you to better place your brand and marketing to deliver better goods and services. The execution can be completed in a matter of hours with automation. Campaign management software aids teams in planning and executing efficient marketing strategies. Gather all appropriate campaign requirements, include relevant team members and stakeholders in an open workspace, and monitor assigned tasks with the right campaign management software to complete the campaign successfully.</p>

<h4>Budget planning, execution and monitoring:</h4>

<p>Users can use this feature to set PPC budgets and ensure that campaign costs do not exceed the set limit. Setting a budget plan and automating its execution with monitoring capabilities is critical when executing search advertising campaigns to ensure businesses get the most value for the money they spend. This is certainly an excellent feature to look out for in PPC software. It relieves the possibility of reckless spending, which in both the long and short term, your business will surely appreciate.</p>

<h4>Keyword research tools:</h4>

<p>This allows you to see how frequently certain words are searched, as well as how those searches have evolved. It enables you to determine which keywords to use in your PPC campaigns. You can also create keyword groups for targeted campaigns with some products. It is a helpful feature. It allows you to analyse different keywords based on specific parameters like location, to provide a list of top-ranking keywords that may prove beneficial to you as a user in your business or product ad campaigns.</p>

<h4>Bid management and optimisation:</h4>

<p>Bid management is automating the bidding process for digital marketing campaigns. Users can use this feature to define, manage, and change the bidding amounts for keywords across multiple channels. Because of algorithms defined by the marketing manager based on the set objectives and available resources, this automated management is possible. They are also handy for automating your CPC (cost-per-click) bids for various campaigns. </p>

<p>This feature helps marketers automate bid changes based on marginal ROI, so they know how much money they'll get for their next dollar. Some search advertising software options include a bid simulator that allows users to estimate the number of clicks, costs, and impressions their ads have received over a given period to optimise future bids.</p>

<h4>Conversion tracking:</h4>

<p>Conversion tracking is the process of determining which clicks result in conversions. A "conversion" isn't always a visitor making a direct purchase on your site; it could be any action that leads to a lead or a positive engagement. So, depending on what your business or product has to offer, the following are a few examples of actions that could be considered conversions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Purchasing an item</li>
<li>Dialling your contact number</li>
<li>Subscribing to your mailing list</li>
<li>Adding a product to their shopping cart</li>
<li>A video is being played.</li>
<li>Your app being downloaded.</li>
</ul>

<p>This feature enables you to get a higher return on investment (ROI) from your advertisements. Knowing which campaigns, ad groups, and keywords are successful allows you to focus your resources on replicating and fine-tuning those working, rather than wasting money on campaigns that aren't.</p>

<h4>Geotargeting:</h4>

<p>Geotargeting is a form of marketing in which advertisements are only displayed to people who live in a specific area. This feature employs the geolocation-based delivery of different information to tourists. Nation, region/state, city, metro code/zip code, organisation, IP address, ISP, or other requirements are all examples. This feature also ensures that your promotions are hyper-targeted to your customers, both in terms of time and place. This means they'll only work when your customers are connected to the internet when they're most likely to come across them. This is a must-have feature to look for in PPC software. Specific geolocation research will help you improve your company or brand in that area. Also, it allows the company or brand to be localised (which can also help your local SEO efforts).</p>

<h4>Keyword tracking:</h4>

<p>The activity of tracking the position of your website for specific keywords is known as keyword tracking. It's a method for obtaining essential data and metrics about particular keywords and demonstrating how well your website ranks for those keywords. </p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/ppc-software-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="keyword tracking" /></p>

<p>This feature allows users to keep track using two (2) different methods, which are;</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of searches (how often the users use such keywords as a search query on the internet).</li>
<li>The degree of competition (how many sites are ranked in search results for a particular keyword).</li>
<li>Keyword tracking will give you valuable insight into how your website and content perform search engine result pages. You'll better understand your website's visibility and where you should concentrate your future search engine optimisation efforts. This tool carries out this task by doing the following;</li>
<li>Determines which content topics would be insightful and beneficial to your audience.</li>
<li>Makes it a point to focus your content creation efforts on the most valuable, high-commercial purpose keywords.</li>
<li>Uses tightly structured ad groups, structure your paid search campaigns to target specific keywords.</li>
</ul>

<h4>A/B testing:</h4>

<p>Users can use this feature to test different variations of a PPC campaign by running test campaigns to see which one performs better. It also aids in optimising search ads by deploying various ad variations, such as calls to action or images, and tracking which ones encourage visitors to convert at a higher rate. Marketers use these tools to boost conversion rates and increase visitors who engage with their brands online. This feature can be integrated with digital analytics and heat maps software to track visitor behaviour on top of web development infrastructure and web content management systems.</p>

<h4>Ad group creation:</h4>

<p>An ad community is a set of advertisements with common goals. One or more ad groups make up each of your campaigns. This feature allows you to build and use ad groups to organise your advertising according to a popular theme. When creating your ad group, this feature ensures that you have integration and consistency. At least three high-quality advertisements should be included in each ad category. Thus, the system will be able to optimise your performance. You will examine your performance data to determine which message resonates better with your target audience. Be sure to build unique ad groups on an excellent account organisation.</p>

<h4>URL Builder:</h4>

<p>Users may use this function to create custom campaign parameters for their advertisement URLs. To collect reporting data about the referring campaign, you can add parameters to a URL (UTM source, UTM medium, and UTM campaign). The URL builder allows you to include parameters in URLs you use in custom web or email ad campaigns. It converts an existing URL into a super URL by appending tracking parameters to it. It's a great feature that lets you use UTM (Urchin Traffic Monitor) codes to help track where your most useful traffic is coming from.</p>

<h4>Ad performance grading:</h4>

<p>This feature provides users with an instant report detailing their PPC ad performance based on their customised AdWords results, allowing them to evaluate their ad performance. Eight primary ad performance metrics are highlighted in the ad performance report, including the Score for quality. Negative keywords are used. CPM (cost per mille), CTR (Click-through rate), RPM (Revenue per 1,000 ad impressions), and RPC (revenue per click) are the four key ways to quantify ad efficiency. This feature accomplishes this by monitoring the reach and impressions of ads and evaluating the engagement rate on each campaign.</p>

<h4>Account Alerts:</h4>

<p>Account alerts notify you of balances, transfers, payments, and other transactions via text or email. It is a helpful feature as it keeps users and marketers updated on the different aspects of the PPC advertisements they monitor.</p>

<h4>Bid rules:</h4>

<p>Marketers may use this feature to set bid rules to reduce pay-per-click costs or increase conversions from the keywords they choose—a rise or decrease in the percentage of your bids. Bid rules allow you to display your ads more frequently or less frequently to depend on where, when, and how people search. You can also alter your bids based on the performance of your ads, which will help you increase your return on investment.</p>

<h4>Analytics/ ROI Tracking:</h4>

<p>This feature keeps track of campaign success metrics (like click-through rate, expense, and conversion rate), return on investment (ROI) as well). This is made possible via an algorithm programmed to utilise the return on advertising spend (ROAS). This feature can track all of a user's transactions through some mathematical calculations while also producing a compound report on it. Be it a cost analysis report or an ROI analysis report.</p>

<h4>Landing Pages:</h4>

<p>A PPC landing page is a standalone web page that you'll use in an AdWords, Bing Ads, or similar paid campaign. It's a particular page where tourists' land' after clicking on a pay-per-click advertisement. A PPC landing page's sole aim is to entice visitors to take a particular predetermined action, for instance, buying a product or service, signing up for a free trial, or downloading a free study. This feature keeps track of all of the keywords you're bidding on and ensures that the landing page is appropriate.</p>
