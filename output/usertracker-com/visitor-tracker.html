                    <p>Website visitor tracking is a practice that allows website owners to collect, view and share the activities of individuals or companies visiting their websites. You can also view these activities in real time. Businesses track site visitors so that they can collect invaluable data about their audience, which they can analyze to unearth crucial information that will help in their sales and marketing efforts. You need an app such as User Tracker to carry out this exercise.</p>

<p>Once you understand your audience, you are empowered to curate valuable content that is tailored to their needs. When site visitors find content that is appealing to them, it encourages them to engage with you. It will also make them return to your site. But how do you get to understand your user profile? Website visitor trackers such as User Tracker were developed to make it easier for businesses to get more insights not only about their websites, but also their visitors as well. </p>

<p>A website visitor tracker will in the long run help your sales “team improve their pipeline and revenue generation,” this is according to Lead Forensics (https://twitter.com/LeadForensics/status/1128660050258558976). </p>

<p>A visitor tracking software allows you to view your visitors’ personal information like their names and location, and enables you to initiate interactivity at any point, should you wish to. Based on your visitors’ trackable behavior, you are able to build accurate profiles of why they are on your site, what their interests are and their position in the buying process. Behaviors to track include:</p>

<ul>
<li>In-page clicks: The number of clicks on a page element such as a call-to-action</li>
<li>Scroll depth: a measure of how far your website visitors are scrolling</li>
<li>Content sharing: individuals sharing content from your page</li>
<li>User engagement: core user actions</li>
<li>Site speed: faster pages increase customer engagement, retention, and conversion</li>
<li>User navigation patterns: how users move from one point to another on your website</li>
<li>Bounces and exits: Bounces are number of single-page visits while exits are the number of exits from your website</li>
<li>Live visitors: real-time update on people visiting your website at any particular time</li>
</ul>

<p>User experience refers to the set of behaviors which consumers display as they interact with a web page. To improve user experience, it is necessary to reduce friction between your page and your target audience. </p>

<p>Researchers at the Missouri University of Science and Technology found that it takes less than two-tenths of a second for an online visitor to form a first opinion of your brand once they've perused your company's website. As such, improving user experience helps to rapidly move and smoothly guide your target audience through the conversion funnel, turning them into leads and leads into customers rather than a statistic of high bounce rate.</p>

<p>There is a marked increase in the number of people working from home and this spike can be largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic that has disrupted the order of business across the world. As such there is lots of online presence and this means businesses will want to catch the attention of people where they are, that is, online. There are equally tons of businesses striving to grab the attention of your potential customer and you thus have to stay on top of your game and you can only do this if you are armed with users’ data, which you can use to optimize your visitor’s experience. Visitor tracking software helps you do exactly that.</p>

<p><strong>Website tracking software</strong></p>

<p>When a customer visits your site, they go through several stages of the marketing funnel namely awareness, consideration, conversion, loyalty and lastly advocacy. The market is flooded with various visitor tracking software and choosing the best tracking software requires one to focus on what they offer. A good tracking software has to offer the following features;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Real time delivery of visitor data</strong> including, name location, the size of the company, full contact details and on-site behavior, that is, what they have searched for, how many times they visited those sites and how long they stayed on those sites.</li>
<li><strong>Categorize visitors and then prioritize the hottest leads</strong>, send them to the sales and marketing team for special focus to move them through the marketing funnel.</li>
<li><strong>Track the original source of each visitor</strong>. Through the referral trail, you can identify the keywords used in the referral trail and experiment with these, to attract more visitors.</li>
<li><strong>Offers a CRM tool</strong> that allows you to add details, reminders, schedule meetings and keep track of your appointments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using website visitor tracking tools can help you improve user experience in various ways;</p>

<p><em>*1. Visitor tracking helps you rank your top landing pages. *</em>
Learning your visitors will help you improve content strategy and optimize the design of your website. This will in turn make it easy for your visitors to navigate your website and navigate through the content with ease.</p>

<p><em>*2. Sourcing the original referral for your website will help you gain more knowledge of the search engines that are sending traffic to your website. *</em>
You can then use this information to increase your online presence where your visitors are most active. This way, you bring your content closer to your visitors, ultimately reducing the time they would usually use to navigate to your page.</p>

<p><em>*3. The amount of errors in your website will determine if your existing visitors will stay or decide to move along. *</em></p>

<p>Visitor tracking software helps to track and optimize error messages which will help you in improving your website and user experience. The most helpful error messages to track are form field errors and 404 pages. Visitor monitoring helps you to track a spike in these errors and then notify you when certain metrics reach a specified threshold. Create a dashboard of these errors to help you with better analysis and fix your website. Reducing the number of errors in your website will ensure your users get an optimized experience.</p>

<p><em>*4. Visitor monitoring helps to analyze your website’s bounce rate. *</em></p>

<p>Bounce rate is the rate at which visitors are coming to your website and either leaving immediately or they never make it past the first page. Bounce rates have become a ranking factor for Google, meaning the lower you are ranked, the harder it is for your target audience to reach you. Improving the content and design of your website can help you keep these bounce rates low and in turn give your users a better user experience by giving them what they are interested in.</p>

<p><em>*5. Behavior flow is a feature offered by most visitor tracking software including User Tracker. *</em></p>

<p>It identifies the most common routes users use to get in and out of specific pages. Comparing behavior flow against the amount of time spent on your website will give you a visual representation of pages that are bridges to specific pages of interest.</p>

<p>Visitors clicking back and forth between pages is a clear indicator of confusion in navigation and misleading design. Behavior flow will help you optimize the number of pages a visitor will have to click through to make a purchase or fill out a subscription form.</p>

<p>Behavior flow also helps you determine at which page your visitors are leaving. If they are leaving at the end, that is a positive thing. If they are leaving prematurely, that is an indication you need to improve your content and design flow to keep them interested and clicking forward.</p>

<p><em>*6. Most visitor tracking software like Google Analytics help you track specific clicks on CTA buttons, links and basically anything interactive. *</em></p>

<p>Event tracking helps you figure out if your visitors are interacting with the interactive elements on a site. Everything that a user can interact with can be tracked with event tracking. Comparing event tracking data to behavior flow will give you a visualization of how your visitors are navigating through the market funnel and specific things that are catching their attention. Making your website interesting enough for users to want to interact will enhance their experience.</p>

<p><em>*7. The audience feature in some visitor tracking tools gives you a comprehensive insight of your visitors. *</em></p>

<p>It gives specific details such as gender, location and even the devices they are using to visit your site. It gives information on your users’ browsers, their operating systems and even the size of their browsers. All these are very important information while designing for the best user experience. </p>

<p>The audience feature helps you get a better insight into visitor patterns, specifically the times of day they mostly visit your website. This will help you better design your marketing campaigns to reach a larger audience. Data on the particular devices and browser window sizes will help you experiment with device-specific layouts and content.
Location of most of your users will determine the language you use on your content or the simplicity of the language, say English.</p>

<p><em>*8. Your visitor tracker should also include a page view feature. *</em></p>

<p>Page view refers to the number of times a page is visited and is good at measuring user engagement. Comparing all page views against unique page views will help you determine whether your visitors are looking at content multiple times or not. This could have different interpretations. It could either mean that the visitors revisit the page as a reliable resource, or they are taking their time looking for reassurance before making a purchase. </p>

<p>Comparing page views and conversion rates will help you determine if visitors are navigating one page to another because they cannot find what they are looking for. High page view and low conversion rate is a negative aspect and should prompt you to reevaluate your website content and design. This could either be due to a broken link or poor navigation. Fixing either of these will help improve user experience.</p>

<p><em>*9. Website visitor tracking tools give you real-time data that will help you reach out to visitors who have recently visited your page before they explore other options. *</em></p>

<p>This will speed up their decision-making process and shorten the conversion time. This fast interactivity makes users feel valued and this personalized attention to their needs works positively towards their conversion.</p>

<p><strong>10. The session replay feature found in a number of trackers enable you to track mouse movements of the users as they browse your website.</strong> </p>

<p>This is done in the form of a record, enabling you to notice details of their interest. This analysis tool helps you enhance user experience and user interface by ensuring that everything your visitors are interested in is on the landing page. This saves users the trouble of clicking through pages. Mouse click detector records reveal design styles which provide higher efficiency. All this works towards maximizing conversion rates.</p>

<p><em>*11. Another tool used by visitor tracking software is destination URL tracking. *</em></p>

<p>Destination pages are priority pages, where you intend your users to land. The ultimate goal is to convert them. Link these landing pages to a specific ad with a specific conversion goal. </p>

<p>Priority pages include:
* Product pages where purchases happen.
* Service pages like contact form submission
* Resource pages where conversion happens, and users are streamlined to your pipeline.</p>

<p>To avoid misdirected traffic to priority pages, destination URL tracking helps identify which channels are funneling the most valuable traffic to your website.</p>

<p><em>*12. In order to improve user experience, it is important to analyze areas of your website where people look at most and the neglected areas. *</em></p>

<p>Heatmaps are a good way to make that analysis. Heatmaps give a visual representation on the areas on your website visitors are clicking and at what frequency. This data tells you exactly what works and what doesn’t, by showing you visitor navigation patterns. Heatmaps offer various methods of data collection and visualization methods including eye tracking heatmap, mouse tracking heatmap, scrollmap and clickmap.</p>

<p>Data collected from the various website heatmaps is actionable and will enable you to optimize the main design element of your website including navigation, CTA buttons and content.</p>

<p>Time on page is another useful feature offered by most visitor tracker tools. </p>

<p>It refers to the time new and repeat users spend on your website. If visitors are spending little time on your page then bouncing off, you need to figure out why. Possible solutions would be to:
* Encourage engagement from users by turning your blog posts into gated e-books.
* Using videos to break off from long content.
* Breaking content into multiple smaller posts which are easily readable.</p>

<p>Easily readable content with a clear streamline to the exit or purchase page boosts user experience and maximizes the conversion rate.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>When a user visits a site, they want to find what they are looking for directly, without jumping through numerous hoops. That said, while the ultimate goal is to get a desired outcome from a user visiting your site, you need to make it possible for them to smoothly navigate through your page and streamline them into your exit page. This requires that you work with a design style that will yield higher efficiency and a good visitor tracking tool will empower you with accurate analytic data to do just that. </p>
