Finding the right email address is important if you want to reach out to an influencer, prepare a list of potential sales leads, or maybe for any other reasons.  Whatever the objective is, when it comes to finding email addresses, most businesses grasp at straws.</p>

<p>To address this issue, we are going to share 10 little-known tricks that’ll help you to get the job done in a jiffy.</p>

<h3><strong>1. <a href='email-lookup'>email lookup</a> Tools</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/email-lookup-tools.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Email Lookup Tools" /></p>

<p>There’re many <a href='email-hunter'>email hunter</a> tools available in the market that you can try out to find someone’s email address. When you use these email lookup tools, you can <a href='find-email-address'>find email address</a>es by using the advanced filtering options. You just need to input the fields like first name, last name, company name, and domain.  To make use of them, few of them might require to simply install the browser extension of these tools or can  directly use it through the web.  </p>

<p>Here are the most popular email lookup tools to help you source and approach your prospects-Vocus.io, Hunter, Hiretual, VoilaNorbert, Anymail Finder, SellHack, Find That, LeadFuze, Webdef, etc. Using these tools is very easy. These tools offer limited free searches, while the unlimited search options will depend on your email hunter plan.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Rocket Reach</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/rocket-reach.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Rocket Reach" /></p>

<p>If you have details, such as the prospect’s name, organization, and LinkedIn profile URL, Rocket Reach is the best tool to search for emails. It enables users to identify potential contacts with the LinkedIn URL option easily.  </p>

<p>Whether it is the professional or personal LinkedIn profile of your prospect, the powerful engine of Rocket Reach works seamlessly to find associated email addresses. If you want to find prospects from AngelList and Crunchbase, Rocket Reach can easily perform that as well.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Finding Through Pattern</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/finding-through-pattern.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Finding Through Pattern" /></p>

<p>Most companies' email addresses follow a common pattern when creating their corporate email id’s. In fact, many companies adhere to one of the following patterns.  </p>

<p><code>first.last@company.com</code>
<code>first.last_inital@company.com</code>
<code>first_initial.last@company.com</code>
<code>first@company.com</code></p>

<p>There is no right way to be successful to find the email right away, but you need to be tactical while using this method. Also, manually checking every possible pattern one-by-one from various sources would be time-consuming and sorting it is more likely to lead to mistakes and inconsistencies.</p>

<p>However, you can use tools available that’ll help you figure out which one of these emails is the right one. Sales Navigator from LinkedIn is a notable name in this regard.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Email Permutator</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/email-permutator.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Email Permutator" /></p>

<p>Email Permutator is an amazing tool that generates a list of possible suggestions for you based on your input data. The process is very simple. You just have to fill in the fields such as the first and last name and the domain name of the company, and it does the rest. This email-finding tool allows you to search up to three domains at the same time.</p>

<p>Email Permutator returns 102 email addresses in a second and you can copy them to your clipboard. For further validation and find out the exact email address of your target, you may use server ping software in the likes of MailTester or Strikeiron.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Mailtester</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/mailtester.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Mailtester" /></p>

<p>If you want to reap better ROI from your email campaigns without spending money on invalid or discarded emails, Mailtester is the ideal solution for you. This is an accurate, efficient, and secured email list cleaning tool that enables you to validate whether your email is getting delivered to the mail server of the target or not.</p>

<p>Mailtester helps reduce bounce rate and increases the domain’s reputation by removing unwanted emails from the list with a large volume of emails. This also ensures a lower bounce rate. And you can enjoy all these by paying a very reasonable subscription charge.</p>

<h3><strong>6. AeroLeads</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/aeroleads.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="AeroLeads" /></p>

With this information, you can conduct searches on professional networking websites, such as ZoomInfo and LinkedIn. These are fertile grounds for harvesting email and other personal information.</p>

<p>For searching, you have two options: key in the search query on the website’s internal search engine or try Google with the following query:</p>

<p><code>[name] + ZoomInfo</code>
<code>[name] + LinkedIn</code></p>

<h3><strong>8. Use Twitter</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/use-twitter.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Use Twitter" /></p>

<p>You can find the email address of your prospects by leveraging their twitter account if you know this trick. In order to hide the email address from bots, advanced Twitter users use “dot” and “at” instead of “.” and “@” in their tweets for Twitter bio.</p>

<p>Use Twitter’s Advanced Search option and search your intended person’s tweets for “at” and “dot”. Also, try different input combinations here. Ignore, hashtags, specific accounts, and time frames and include words, such as “email,” “reach” or “contact”.
Another way to approach them is through their direct messages, but it also depends on their privacy settings. You can press Ctrl/Cmd+F and search for:
 - <strong>@domainname</strong>
 - <strong>“contact”</strong>
 - <strong>“email”</strong>
 - <strong>“you can reach me at”</strong>
 - <strong>And other variations</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/export-email-address-from-linkedIn.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Export Email Address from LinkedIn" /></p>

<p>You might be connected with a person on LinkedIn, but the email of that person will not be there in your Google Contacts list. Therefore, how can you get the email address? </p>

<p>You can use LinkedIn’s advanced settings and then try the export option. This will export the up-to-date email address of your connections right in your inbox who have allowed their connections to see or download their email address.To perform this task, you can deploy a tool as well. There are many automated tools available on the market that come with this smart feature.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Email Finder tool Finder.io</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/email-finder-tool-finder.io.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Email Finder tool Finder.io" /></p>

<p>Few email finder solutions only offer email finding and you need to depend upon other third-party tools to get those email IDs validated. Avoiding these tools can help you save both time and resources. Opt for an automated tool like <a href="https://finder.io/">Finder.io</a> that comes with all-in-one features  so that your team can run email marketing campaigns confidently without worrying much about bounce rates.</p>
