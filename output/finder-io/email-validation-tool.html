<p>In order to make the most of email marketing and in order to realize its full potential though, it is important to have a good email strategy and an effective email list. In fact, one of the most crucial pre-requisites to successful email marketing is a good quality email list with valid email addresses of important decision makers, who can quickly make purchase decisions.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">“  Customer Loyalty is mostly about choosing the right customers. - <a href="https://ducttapemarketing.com/customer-loyalty-2/ ">John Jantsch</a> ”</span> </p>

<p>This is where email validation can help you. Companies often make use of email validation tools to find accurate and valid email IDs of the right people in companies. These tools offer well-designed features to look up and find email addresses ready to be contacted, with just first names and company names of prospects. They also offer tools to verify the authenticity of email IDs and remove or correct invalid ones in an email list. Other than that they also offer interesting analytics and reports to help you gauge the performance of your team with respect to lead generation and email marketing.</p>

<h2><strong>What is email validation?</strong></h2>

<p>Email validation is the process by which email addresses are checked for their authenticity, validity and activity. With an email validation tool you can quickly check if a certain email ID is real or whether it exists. You can also check if it belongs to the right decision maker and whether it has any errors.</p>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/email-validation-tool-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="email-validation-tool2" /></p>

<p>Companies typically use comprehensive email validation tools that offer features to not only check and verify emails but also find the right people to contact, along with their email addresses. Some of the most efficient tools also offer browser extensions to enable email finding on the go. They crawl through websites of prospective clients that you check out and return authentic email addresses of all the relevant business professionals associated with the company. Apart from that they also provide reliable analytics to help you make improvements.</p>

<p>Finder.io is one such efficient email validation tool that comes with a Chrome extension to help you find and verify email IDs on the fly.

<h2><strong>Why should you use email validation?</strong></h2>

<p>Lead capturing or lead generation is one of the most challenging aspects of email marketing. This is because it requires real, authentic and valid email IDs of the right decision makers in prospective companies.</p>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/email-validation-tool-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Why should you use email validation" /></p>

<p>However, not every lead that signs up or is captured by opt-in tools may provide the right email IDs. Manual mistakes may arise in typing, and furthermore the people who checked out your website may not be the right managerial personnel in charge of taking purchase decisions. Some companies may also leave generic email IDs on lead generation forms assigned to mere designations, which would prove to be ineffective and unresponsive to your marketing emails. </p>

<p>Above all of these, some people may simply leave unauthentic email IDs for security reasons.</p>

<p>All of these factors can cause leads captured through different means to become ineffective. There is no point talking to the wrong people in an organization as there are little to no chances of them converting into a paying customer. At same time there is no point sending emails to fake and incorrect email IDs. It will only cause your email ID to lose credibility over time and even risks being blocked by email service providers.</p>

<p>This is why it is extremely important to clean up email lists before sending out email campaigns. It helps boost your effectiveness significantly and improves your conversion rates.</p>
