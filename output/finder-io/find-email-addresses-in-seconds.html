<h1>12 useful tips for finding email addresses</h1>

<p>The following are some of the most proven and effective methods of finding the right emails for whatsoever purpose you deem fit. Actually, finding an email that has been previously shared publicly is almost inevitable if these methods are carefully and thoroughly executed. This <a href="http://twitter.com/kerryryan0/status/794318772198920200?s=21">Tweet</a> By <a href="http://twitter.com/andyheadworth?s=21">Andy Headworth</a> Helps to address some of the useful tips.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Go through the contact and about us pages of the target’s website</strong>: Ideally, the name of these pages explains why they are one of the major ways of finding email addresses. Even astonishingly, it has been established repeatedly in different scenarios that the most simple solutions often turn out to be the best.
Most at times, many websites tend to make personal email addresses available on the contact and about us pages.
Now while it may sound very cliché, the truth is most of the time, there wouldn’t be a need to go through any other rigorous process of searching as the required emails are often available on these pages.
A slight hiccup that might come up with this approach is the slight difficulty that comes with navigating the web page and finding where exactly such email addresses are located on the page. If you can't find it, you should look at the footer or search for search queries that could provide excellent results.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lookup the WHOIS database</strong>: The WHOIS database is a listing of all registered domains in use. It is often used for legal purposes and hence contains almost all the details about any registered domain of any person’s email. A shot of WHOIS database is expressed in this. This technique is best suited for individuals or organizations who have a registered domain. E.g. independent business owners, entrepreneurs, or writers. Most at times, at the point of registering their domains, the database often requires them to supply some sort of contact information which is often the email address. Individuals who have a registered domain name are bound by law to share their contact information. As such, by just heading to Who.is and looking through the database, you might find the email address of the target. <br />
To simplify the process considering the fact that the sheer volume of information available on the WHOIS database is very much making it almost impossible to check through manually, third party tools that serve as WHOIS lookup tools can be used. Some of them include NameCheap, Nominet, and DomainTools.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google search</strong>:  As of now, a Google search is becoming more or less the textbook standard way of searching for just about anything on the internet. Therefore, the same thing applies to finding emails. All you need do is type in the name of the person whose email you are searching for and follow it up with  “email address” in the search input field; hit search and expect to find it in the SERPs if the email has been publicly shared before.
Some individuals who have quite a common name can prove a tad bit difficult to find using a mere google search. It might require a little bit of more technique or perhaps more specific information about the individual whose email addresses you seek.
For individuals who have background knowledge about search engine optimization as a whole as well as the use of specific characters that serve as unique search operators can help streamline the search a little bit more towards the desired result. At other times, merely typing the name of the target alongside email does magic.  </p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Twitter’s advanced search</strong>:  Everybody is on Twitter these days. It’s becoming more of a marketplace where a lot of things go down ranging from interpersonal relationships to business relations. It is therefore very reasonable to search for just about anything on Twitter so far it is digital of course. 
Considering the fact that prospects, clients, entrepreneurs, salesperson and marketers amongst other categories of individuals are continuously trying to reach out to other individuals that can make them achieve their goals and aims when they come on Twitter, they tend to try to leverage the fact that every other person that might help further their course is on the same platform at the same time. As a result, people are often dropping their emails on Twitter. However, sometimes, some people cipher some characters in the email address; for instance the ‘.’ Is replaced with “dot” and the ‘@’ is replaced with ‘at”.
Therefore, using twitter’s advanced search, one could search for the keywords “dot” and “at” as well as “contact” and “reach”
Still on Twitter, a more direct approach is by simply tweeting at the target individuals stating concisely that you would like to have their email address and of course why you would like to have it. Going through the direct messages could also prove to be very fruitful In some other situations than mere mentions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make use of Email finding tools like<a href="http://finder.io/"> Finder.io</a></strong>: Tools that leverage technology like <a href="http://finder.io/">Finder.io</a> makes it very easy to locate and search emails online. <a href="http://finder.io/">Finder.io</a> particularly makes it easy to connect with single individuals as well as gathering a long list of emails of people in a specific niche in a very short period of time

</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Subscribe to the mailing list of your target</strong>: Should in case the person or organization’s email you are searching for also has a mailing list and continuously sends out emails and newsletters, it would be a very smart idea to log on to the person’s website and subscribe to such a mailing list. This is because most times, newsletters are often sent from personal emails.
Even if such a newsletter is not sent from a personal mail, it's smart to try to reply one of the mails having followed the message closely and replying or engaging meaningfully with what the target is talking about. Considering the fact that most people always appreciate feedback as a form of reinforcement that they are actually communicating with someone. This is very likely to improve your relationship with such a target.
Having the mail you first is an interesting avenue for you to mail them back and of course get their emails.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask for it via contact forms or generic emails</strong>: If you are trying to get the personal email addresses of individuals who work at a company or occupy major positions, it is quite straightforward.
All you need to do is to locate the contact and address forms on their website as well as the generic emails listed on their website. They are often handled by support teams. Once you can access this, you need to shoot them a simple mail asking that they reply you with the personal email of the person you wish to reach out to. Doing this of course requires you to state your genuine reasons</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use your own email list</strong>: Sometimes what we seek is nearer than we might imagine. For individuals who have some sort of visibility in their industry or niche, quite a number of people might have subscribed to your own email list such that if you were to be searching for a person, there’s every probability that the person you are searching for is in your email list. 
It is understandable that individuals who perhaps have a large audience and as a result have a long list of emails to look through might not find the experience palatable. To eliminate this stress, most email marketing software has functionalities that make it easy to search through that long list of email addresses and contact information.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Export your LinkedIn Connections</strong>:  When trying to carry out an email outreach, there’s every probability that your connections on LinkedIn fall in the category of your target audience for such a mailing outreach. There’s a tool on LinkedIn that makes it easy to export your connections while also giving contact information about them. This <a href="http://twitter.com/617patrick/status/1773797713?s=21">Tweet</a> By <a href="http://twitter.com/617patrick?s=21">Patrick O’Malley</a> Talks about how to go about this.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">LinkedIn tip – Exporting your connections, or “How do I send a bulk email to my connections?” http://bit.ly/10ZR7J</p>&mdash; Patrick O&#39;Malley (@617patrick) <a href="https://twitter.com/617patrick/status/1773797713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2009</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
You are expected to click “me” at the top of the LinkedIn homepage after which you should click on “settings &amp; privacy” from the dropdown. On doing this, a “privacy” button should be clicked to expose the “getting a copy of your data” link. The final step requires you to tick all the boxes beside all the connections and hit “request archive”.
On doing this; following the processes highlighted above properly, you should get an email of the email addresses of the ticked connections in your own mailbox in a little about eight to ten minutes. It is very worthy of note that if this technique is not used responsibly, you risk losing your LinkedIn account as LinkedIn has tight regulations as regards to privacy protection policies.  </p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ask a mutual friend to introduce you</strong>: When trying to get up close and personal with someone who seems far away or perhaps a total stranger, one of the most efficient ways to build that strong and personal relationship is if trust can be established pretty quickly.
In building human relationships being introduced by someone who such a person has developed a certain level of trust in overtime definitely serves as a form of boost in facilitating that relationship.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Take a guess</strong>: Well, we all know what taking a guess is some sort of trial and error process. However, when trying to get the email address of a person, an educated and well-informed guess can sometimes prove invaluable and can provide excellent results.  </p></li>
