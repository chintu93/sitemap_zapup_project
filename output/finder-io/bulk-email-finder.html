                    <p>It is an established fact by now that email marketing is one of the most powerful sources of lead generation, lead nurturing and even conversions. More companies are looking to adopt email marketing software to up their proficiency in email marketing. </p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/20-insightful-lead-nurturing-statistics-charts/">latest statistics</a>, 79% of some of the top performing companies have been using marketing automation software for the past three or more years. And as much as 91% of software users believe that marketing automation is “very important” for successfully implementing marketing across multiple channels. </p>

<p>In terms of lead generation, almost 80% of marketers use automation software to generate more leads.
However, <a href="http://e61c88871f1fbaa6388d-c1e3bb10b0333d7ff7aa972d61f8c669.r29.cf1.rackcdn.com/DGR_DG072_SURV_BenchmarkSurvey_Jan_2018_Final.pdf">73% of them</a> focus on lead quality over lead quantity. This means, more than the number of leads, companies are more concerned about how good the leads are.</p>

<p>From all of these numbers, it is evident that lead generation, along with the quality of the email list is very important when it comes to email marketing.</p>

<p>The Dairy Creative Agency further reiterates the fact that quality is more crucial than quantity when it comes to building effective email lists in <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDairyAgency/status/1336412051485372420">this post</a>. </p>

<p>Different lead capturing and generating techniques like forms, landing pages and pop ups that collect customer information can generate incorrect or unreliable email IDs which immensely reduces the effectiveness of your email campaigns. Along with that some people may leave incomplete information. </p>

<p>Apart from all of these, you may be able to capture leads from other sources as well, where you only have their first names or their IP addresses or merely their company name to begin with.</p>

<p>This is precisely why you absolutely need processes like email verification, email finding and list cleaning in order to generate more reliable and accurate email lists. </p>

<p>And for all these things, you need bulk email finder software. It offers a number of dedicated features for email verification as well as for finding emails, with which you can easily obtain specific email IDs of relevant people in companies. What it effectively does is direct you towards the right decision makers in an organization, thereby improving your chances for conversion. This way, it helps businesses generate more reliable and high quality email lists for email marketing.</p>

<h2><strong>Why do you need a bulk email finder?</strong></h2>

<p>An accurate email list is very crucial to the success of your email marketing campaigns. Not all the email IDs that you’ve generated through different means is correct and valid. Manual errors in typing, syntax errors, incorrect and fake email IDs can all crop up, all of which will adversely affect your overall deliverability and credibility.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a lot of the leads that you capture may leave incomplete info, with possibly the right contact information in terms of company names or first names, but doesn’t guarantee the right email ID. And even if the email ID is authentic and real, chances are, it doesn’t belong to the right decision maker in the company.</p>

<p>Clearly, collecting the right email IDs and creating an effective email list is not an easy thing. It is a time consuming and tedious task, and it gets even more difficult when the number of generated leads or prospects increases. And you cannot let any possible chance for a sale go without pursuing either.</p>

<p>This is where bulk email finder tools can help you greatly.</p>

<p>You cannot afford to have constantly dwindling sender scores and low open and click through rates for a long time, as they will render you out of businesses very soon. The market is quite competitive.</p>
