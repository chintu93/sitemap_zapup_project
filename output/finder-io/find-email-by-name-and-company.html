<p>Newsletters are the new way companies and executives are contacting their prospects - and its your chance to use them to find email by name and company! </p>

<p>You see, most companies use email newsletters on a regular basis to communicate out to their customers or blast out offers. As a marketer, you need to subscribe to these emails. This brings you an excellent opportunity to establish a relationship and find the email address for your marketing outreach efforts. </p>

<p>The fact is that in many cases these newsletters come with contact details of the respective stakeholder and you might get the email address of the person you want to reach out to. If not, just get more creative and reply to the newsletter/email, appreciate their posts, and ask for the required contact details.</p>

<p>This method also comes with an added advantage. By subscribing to the newsletter, you’re already sending a message to the webmaster that you would like to build a relationship, which is very important for marketing outreach. </p>

<h3><strong>5. Use LinkedIn and Twitter Advanced Search Features</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-email-by-name-and-company-5.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="email search LinkedIn &amp; Twitter" /></p>

<p>One of the quickest ways to find email by name and company is to use the advanced search options of <a href="http://Linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> and Twitter. You can simply head over to <a href="http://Linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> advanced search and type the name of the company that your prospect works for. LinkedIn will return a list of relevant people who work in that company. If the company is big, the list will be extensive. Here you should include specific keywords or titles to narrow down the search.</p>

<p>In order to hide the email address from bots, many Twitter users include “dot” and “at” instead of “.” and “@”. You can bypass this by using the Twitter Advanced Search.</p>

<p>Head to that section and search your prospect’s tweets for “at” and “dot”. You may also include words, such as email, reach, or contact to filter the results further.</p>
