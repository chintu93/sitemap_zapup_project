<p>Finding the right email address is important if you want to reach out to an influencer, prepare a list of potential sales leads, or for any number of other reasons.  Whatever the objective is, when it comes to finding email addresses, many businesses grasp at straws.</p>

<p>Businesses use a variety of channels to reach consumers and prospective clients or customers. While social media and paid ads are both great ways to achieve this, email marketing has long been one of the most rewarding marketing channels in the world.</p>

<p>With a solid strategy, successful email marketing can <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/how-do-you-calculate-email-marketing-roi/">return as much as 4400%!</a> That means that for every dollar invested in email campaigns, you could make a profit of $43!</p>

<p>There’s always been debate on the continued efficacy of email marketing. In reality, if your email marketing efforts aren’t paying off, you’re doing something wrong! </p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">Email marketing is still going strong today, and is possibly the best possible strategy for your business, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/beginners-guide-email-marketing/?lang_geo=us">says Patel</a>.</span></p>

<p>One of the reasons email campaigns often fail is that marketers simply don’t have good email lists. Your email campaigns live and die by the email list you use. If your list is full of untargeted, uninterested, or unauthentic email addresses, your campaigns will likely fail. Even worse, you could end up in one too many spam folders and hurt your chances of email success in the future.</p>

<p>The key to realizing great returns from your email marketing efforts is to ensure you have great email lists.</p>

<p>And so, our experts at Finder.io put together a list of tips and tricks you can use to dig up authentic email addresses for the decision-makers and influencers you’ve been dying to reach.</p>

<h3><strong>1. Email Lookup Tools</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Popular email lookup tools include:</strong>

<h3><strong>3. Finding Through Pattern</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-work-emails-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Finding Through Pattern" /></p>

<p>It’s also possible to find work emails by following a common pattern that some companies use when creating their corporate email addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Many companies adhere to one of the following patterns:</strong>
* first.last@company.com
* first.last<em>inital@company.com
* first</em>initial.last@company.com
* first@company.com</p>

<p>There is no right or wrong way to use this method. It is one of the more time consuming methods on the list, but you can use tools like <a href="https://finder.io/email-verifier">Finder.io’s Email Verifier</a> to confirm the validity of one or more email addresses simultaneously.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Email Permutator</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-work-emails-4.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Email Permutator" /></p>

<p><a href="https://quickmail.io/email-permutator/">Email permutators</a> are amazing tools that generate a list of possible suggestions for you based on your input data. The process is very simple.

<h3><strong>5. Mailtester</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-work-emails-5.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Mailtester" /></p>

<p><a href="https://aeroleads.com/">AeroLeads</a> is another popular lead generation software that helps users find email addresses and phone numbers of relevant prospects in real-time, and then download the data into CSV files or export it to CRMs such as Salesforce, MailChimp, and HubSpot.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Business Networking Search Queries</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-work-emails-7.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Business Networking Search Queries" /></p>

<p>If you are searching for someone’s email and you know the person’s name and the organization where the person works, you can perform business networking queries. <br />
With this information, you can conduct searches on professional networking websites, such as ZoomInfo and LinkedIn. These are fertile grounds for harvesting email and other personal information.</p>

<p>To conduct these searches, simply key in the search query on the website’s internal search engine.</p>

<p><strong>Additionally, you can search on Google with the following query format:</strong>
* [name] + ZoomInfo
* [name] + LinkedIn</p>

<h3><strong>8. Use Twitter</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-work-emails-8.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Use Twitter" /></p>

<p>You can also find the email address of your prospect by leveraging info available from their Twitter account. In order to hide the email address from bots, advanced Twitter users use the word <em>“dot”</em> or <em>“at”</em> instead of a period or the <em>“@”</em> symbol in their tweets for Twitter bio. Keep that in mind when searching.</p>

<p>Use Twitter’s Advanced Search option and search your prospect’s tweets for <em>“at”</em> or <em>“dot.”</em> </p>

<p>Additionally, try different input combinations here. Ignore hashtags, specific accounts, and time frames, and include words such as <em>“email,” “reach,”</em> or <em>“contact.”</em></p>

<p>Another way to approach them is through their direct messages, but it also depends on their privacy settings.</p>

<p><strong>On the prospect’s profile, press Ctrl/Cmd+F and search for:</strong>
 * <em>“@domainname”</em>
 * <em>”contact”</em>
 * <em>”email”</em>
 * <em>”you can reach me at”</em></p>

<h3><strong>9. Export Email Address from LinkedIn</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-work-emails-9.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Export Email Address from LinkedIn" /></p>

<p>You can also use LinkedIn’s advanced settings in conjunction with their export option to attempt to find work emails and export them. This will export the up-to-date email address of your connections right in your inbox, as long as they have allowed their connections to see or download their email addresses.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Email Finder tool Finder.io</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-work-emails-10.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Email Finder tool Finder.io" /></p>
