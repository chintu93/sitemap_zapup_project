                    <p>Cold emailing has always been the thing to look for every marketer out there. It's a practice that has seen many changes and transformation since it's inception. No wonder, cold email has helped marketers find and generate leads extensively. 
In this blog, we'll see some of the specific ways that cold emailing may be changing in 2021. It's a good idea to adjust your current strategy to meet these trends.</p>

<h2><strong>Cold Email Tips You Should Be Using</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Using Subject Lines that Grab Attention</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/cold-email-campaigns-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="use subject line" /></p>

<p>When your inbox is flooded with emails, generally you scroll fast until you find something that catches your eye. <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/3-ways-your-cold-email-campaigns-need-to-change-in-2020/#.XmnagWUzaV4">Before crafting the subject line</a> for your cold email campaigns. You will perhaps never write such short copy with such a big impact as you will when you craft the subject line of your cold emails, so make them concise, witty, fun, and above all, targeted to emotions, problems, and needs.</p>

<h3><strong>Personalizing Every Element</strong></h3>

<p>Personalization is especially important in cold email campaigns. If you're simply blasting emails to everyone without personalizing the subject line, body, and overall message, your prospects will likely overlook your emails, or if they do read them, will not reply. Emails crafted with <a href="https://woodpecker.co/blog/cold-email-benchmarks-2020/">personalized messages</a> receive higher open rates and reply rates.</p>

<p>There's always a way to personalize an email, and there are areas you can personalize that you may have never thought to look. For instance, the first bit of text in the body of an email actually shows up in the prospect's inbox without them even opening the email. This ""second subject line,"" as it's sometimes called, is situated next to the subject line and provides a preview to the recipient. It also happens to provides an excellent opportunity for you to tailor your content to a specific audience. Keep in mind that at the end of the day, people don't respond well to messages that sound robotic or generic. When crafting the copy of your cold email, itâ€™s important that your words seem personal  generate a personable mood. Refrain from a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach and speak directly to your audience.</p>

<h3><strong>A/B Testing for Performance</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/cold-email-campaigns-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="A/B testing" /></p>

<p>A/B testing, or ""split testing,"" is an essential part of email marketing in general. However, many marketers and sales professionals fail to grasp the importance of A/B testing when it comes to <em>cold</em> email marketing campaigns. The reason is that A/B testing is conducted by comparing data from two or more groups, demographics, or campaigns. Because cold email campaigns, by their nature, involve less data than other types of campaigns, it's assumed that data collection and data analysis aren't as important here.</p>

<p>In reality, you need <a href="https://woodpecker.co/blog/cold-email-benchmarks-2020/">A/B testing</a> to determine which campaigns will be successful before sending emails to your prospects. This testing allows you to see which approach is more successful in a given scenario. Data from previous campaigns is invaluable in determining the kinds of content that are more interesting and engaging for readers.</p>

<p>When it comes to email marketing, A/B testing can compare a number of variables, including multiple taglines, descriptions, subject lines, and especially the body of your emails. You'll want to test multiple emails in measurable ways so that you can take a scientific approach to learn what makes your product or service compelling in the eyes of the everyday prospect.</p>

<h3><strong>Get to Know Your Prospects</strong></h3>

<p>Instead of pitching sales straightaway, it's much more beneficial to <a href="https://woodpecker.co/blog/cold-email-benchmarks-2020/">understand your prospectâ€™s business</a> and problems they may be facing and incorporate that information into your cold email campaigns. The key here is to avoid coming off as pushy and sales-driven. You want to come off as personable and helpful. To establish rapport, you should ensure that you have a firm grasp on the problems your prospect faces throughout their workday.</p>

<p>You can call it intelligence-gathering or data-collection, but the goal is to learn as much as possible about your prospect, their business, and any problems or challenges that you can help with. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter facilitate this process and make it easy to get to know your prospects.</p>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/cold-email-campaigns-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="use secondary research and data" /></p>

<h3><strong>Using the Call to Action</strong></h3>

<p>When you start a cold email campaign, your goal is not just to increase brand exposure. While it's great to get your brand name in front of as many eyes as possible, most prospects need to be guided through the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey">buyer journey</a>. In the case of cold email campaigns, the buyer journey is filled with points of interaction that start with the cold email campaigns and end with a sale. By the end of the first email, they should know exactly what to do to learn more about your product, service, or brand. To do this, marketers utilize the call to action.</p>

<p>A call to action, or CTA, is a request or suggestion presented to prospects in a way that nudges them toward taking a particular action. In other words, it's ""the ask."" The CTA should be included in every email, because every email campaign has an overarching goal. However, if you <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/3-ways-your-cold-email-campaigns-need-to-change-in-2020/#.Xmnag2UzaV4">put too much pressure on prospects</a> to make a purchase immediately, they likely never will. So instead of pushing for a sale in the first email, it's better to push for a relationship. As Crazy Egg founder Neil Patel put it: <em>""This is a relationship-building email. You arenâ€™t 'going in for the kill' right now. The goal of this cold email is to simply introduce yourself, tell the person more about who you are and take the first step in becoming business acquaintances.</em> </p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>If you haven't updated your cold email campaigns strategies in a while, now is the time to act. These effective tips will help your brand thrive in any marketplace or niche. But, you can't send effective emails if you don't already have an list of prospects.
