                    <p>Before cold emailing and external links came into existence, the approach by sales teams was to meet new customers by attending events. All they wanted was to start a conversation, but not directly about sales. It's more about introducing the vision and mission of the company to the prospects and also understanding their business so that they can have a professional bond.</p>

<p>In a similar fashion, cold emailing works the same. Your goals when cold emailing can be sales-driven but they can also focus on crafting an image for your brand and engaging readers for the first time in a way that strengthens relationships. Let’s explore the crucial ways your cold email campaigns need to change in order to make a lasting impact (and close more deals) as a marketer.</p>

<h2><strong>Use an Interesting Subject Line</strong></h2>

<p>The email subject is what determines whether the recipient will open and read the contents of your email or delete it. </p>

<p>When your email inbox is flooded with emails, generally you scroll fast until you find an interesting subject line. This is the reason why as a marketer you should think a lot before crafting the subject line for your cold email campaign. You will perhaps never write such a short copy with such a big impact as with the subject line of your cold emails, so make them snappy, witty, quick, fun, and above all effective and targeted to emotions and needs.</p>

<h2><strong>Send a Test Email</strong></h2>

<p>One of the most underrated cold emailing tips is that markers forget to test their emails. After crafting your email on <a href="http://mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a>, <a href="http://aweber.com">Aweber</a>, or on another platform, it is important to note that they might display differently on another persons device. Always remember to send yourself a test email and make sure that it is well rendered on all devices. Most mailing platforms have this preview. </p>

<a href="https://woodpecker.co/blog/how-to-make-my-cold-emails-personal-vol-1-research/">According to a research by Woodpecker</a>, personalized emails receive higher open rates and reply rates.</p>

<p>Even if you are not able to personalize in advanced ways due to the nature of cold emailing, remember that people still don't like messages that sound robotic or generic. When crafting the copy of your cold email it’s important that your words generate a positive and personal mood so that it seems that you are speaking directly to your customer.</p>

<p>Examples of personalization include mentioning their names on the emails subject lines, or even complimenting them or their company in the body of the cold email. </p>
