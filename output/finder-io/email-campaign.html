<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/email-campaign-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Laser Target Your Audience" /></p>

<p>You don’t need to send out an email to all the contacts in your email list. Instead, segment them according to specific demographics, such as age, location, gender, interests, products purchased, etc. so you can better target your marketing campaigns.  People that are more likely to be interested in the content you send will be much more likely to open, read, click, etc. and more likely to trust that the email you send is going to be of value to them.  </p>

<h3><strong>3. Use Genuine Subject Lines</strong></h3>

<p>False and misleading subject lines in your email campaign are an excellent way to get your readers to lose trust in you.</p>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/email-campaign-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Use Genuine Subject Lines" /></p>

<p>In order to convince recipients to open their emails, some email marketers try fancy or misleading subject lines to increase open rates. What they do not understand is that email open rates do not necessarily convert to sales; in fact, they dent your trust and definitely increase your unsubscribe rates. You readers what you to offer what you promised in your subject line in the actual email.</p>

<p>The first time one of your email campaign subscribers opens an email based on the subject line and the content within the email is not related, you’ve lost them forever.  They’ll never trust one of your emails again.  It’s difficult to trust a product from a company you don’t trust.  As a marketer, it is important to use genuine subject lines and always avoid misleading subject lines at all cost.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Ask Your Target For The Permission To Receive Your Content</strong></h3>

<img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/email-campaign-4.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Ask Your Target For The Permission To Receive Your Content" /></p>

<p>Some email marketers are so pushy with their email campaigns that they forget basic email marketing etiquitte which dictates that its only polite to ask your target for permission to receive your emails. As a rule of the thumb, in order to have the full trust of your readers and prospects, make sure they actually want to receive your emails.  Give them options to opt-in to your emails. This is where valuable content such as a newsletter can come in handy.  Give an option such as “Like what you see here?  Receive our monthly newsletter to see more!”  </p>

<p>Sending unsolicited email to unsuspecting recipients without their permission can make your marketing emails land in spam filters. And, worse, it will lead to them losing their trust in your organization.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Personalize Your Emails</strong></h3>

<p>Based on the data you have, you can send very personalized emails to your prospects and this will have a very lasting impact on how they perceive your organization. For example, if you are targetting a certain person in an organization, mentioning their names on the subject line can send a message that your email is very personal and directed to only them. </p>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/email-campaign-5.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Personalize Your Emails" /></p>

<p>If you are running a cold email campaign, doing prior research on your target has proved to be very effective. You can personalize such emails by giving them a compliment about their business or organization in the email body. Mention something about their business or website that will instantly send the message that your email is unique only to them. </p>

<p>Providing this personalized touch and contextualized content in each email campaign will have a positive effect on your customers’ trust in you and your products, instantly solidifying your relationship with them and increasing your chances of converting them to paying customers for whatever you are selling to them.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Use Conversational Language In Your Emails</strong></h3>

<p>One of the most important aspects that most marketers forget is that your buyers or prospects are also human. Address them as humans and use a tone and language they can relate with. </p>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/email-campaign-6.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Use Conversational Language In Your Emails" /></p>

<p>In your email marketing campaigns, you should stay away from formal and stuffy language as this only dents trust with your readers.  To get build trust with them, make your language more conversational and less formal.  This will make your readers feel more connected to you as a human being and less like sales targets. </p>

<p>Showing your human side will also help your customers see you as a real person and not just a business. Sharing some personal information or personal stories and experience to humanize you can make you come across as more friendly and personable.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Use Reply-able and Consistent Email Addresses</strong></h3>

<p>When running an email campaign, the response or clicks you get are the measure of your success. One of the ways to give your readers the motivation to reply to you is making sure that they feel comfortable with you. They want to respond to a person, and in the same voice you should make sure that the email you use to send your newsletters to them is reply-able. </p>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/email-campaign-7.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Use Reply-able and Consistent Email Addresses" /></p>

<p>Avoid at all costs using generic email addresses like info@example.com or machine-generated emails like donotreply<em>this</em>ghymmdomain@example.com. These will make them lose trust in you instantly. Instead, use an email address that has a human feel to it and that is consistent with your domain name and brand. For example, mike@example.com.</p>
