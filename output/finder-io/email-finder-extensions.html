                    <p>Email marketing is a powerful marketing channel for sure. However, in order for it to work and unleash all of its much raved about benefits, there is a certain prerequisite – a good quality list of potential leads.</p>

<p>Building a good email list is one of the most challenging aspects of email marketing. Not just because of the strategic efforts involved in lead capturing and inducing visitors to fill out their contact information but also because of the cumbersome process of finding and validating accurate email IDs.</p>

<p>Lead generation as a whole is essentially all about finding the right email IDs. It is when targeted emails are created and sent to the right people with the right email IDs that the full power of email marketing is realized. And by right email ID, it doesn’t just mean ensuring a valid address for deliverability, but it is also about directing emails to the right decision makers within a company.</p>

<p>This is why it is extremely important to have the right email IDs. Sending emails to the wrong IDs and the wrong people can immensely affect click through rates, open rates and of course deliverability, ultimately standing the risk of being tagged as a spammer. As a matter of fact, pursuing the wrong person within an organization is not only a waste of time, but is a potential dead end in terms of conversion.</p>

<p>For all these reasons and more, it has become inevitable for companies to use email finder tools for effective lead generation.
