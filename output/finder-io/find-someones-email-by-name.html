                    <p>Today, there are almost <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats">4 billion daily email users worldwide</a>. That’s about half of the world’s population. Your clients, consumers, and prospects are all using email. Email marketing is equally crucial to the success of both B2B and B2C outreach campaigns, and it’s particularly effective with millennials, 73% of whom “prefer communications from businesses to come via email.” (<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats">source</a>)</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MYTH: email marketing is outdated.<br><br>TRUTH: if you do it right, it&#39;s one of the most effective tools there is.</p>&mdash; Shama Hyder (@Shama) <a href="https://twitter.com/Shama/status/1308454110111371264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Email marketing is far from dead. In fact, it’s still regarded as one of the most powerful marketing tools used today.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">Nowadays, marketers put a lot of emphasis on chatbots, Instagram influencers, and other new opportunities to reach their customers, explains HubSpot’s <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats">Caroline Forsey.</a>.</span> </p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">But your contemporary communication methods shouldn't distract you from one of the oldest and yet most effective messaging channels -- email.</span></p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">You might be wondering if email is still a worthwhile marketing strategy. Well, it is. In fact, email generates $38 for every $1 spent, which is an astounding 3,800% ROI, making it one of the most effective options available.</span></p>

<p>There’s a variety of obstacles inherent in email marketing, from subject lines that don’t engage to calls-to-action (CTAs) that don’t motivate readers to take action. With so many moving parts, it pays to have a dedicated app to help streamline and automate as many tasks as possible. </p>

<p>The ability to find someone’s email by name probably sounds too good to be true. After all, many email users keep their contact information secure. In your personal life, it’s important to protect your privacy. In the world of B2B and B2C sales, however, companies need to be accessible. </p>

<p>Finder.io takes advantage of this truth by automating the process of searching for emails, enabling you to find someone’s email by name or domain, without having to scour Google SERPs for hours, coming away with email addresses you’re not even sure are valid. Finder.io helps you find and verify target emails with ease.</p>

<p>The following list aims to present the features and benefits of Finder.io in greater detail, enabling you to consider what you need out of an email search and validation solution, and see if Finder.io is the best fit for your business.</p>

<h3><strong>1. Domain Search</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-someones-email-by-name-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Domain Search" /></p>

<p>Finder.io offers a great domain search capability. For instance, if you only have a company name or website, the domain search feature enables you to find any email address. This is very useful in scenarios where you need to approach a person from a particular company but you have no clue about the email address of that person.</p>

<p>Once you enter the company name or the domain name in the search box, the Domain Search of Finder.io returns the list of employees with their names and email addresses. This tool gets email addresses indexed and also combines filter options so that you can easily select the email address and reach out to the people of your choice.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Email Finder</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-someones-email-by-name-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Email Finder" /></p>

<p>Quickly find and connect with prospects with the Email Finder feature of Finder.io. Search one-by-one or in bulk to find someone’s email by name, company name, or business name.</p>

<p>In order to find the email of a person, you just need to enter the name along with the domain name in the Email Finder section. Finder.io then scours the internet for contact information, using variables such as email formats, email addresses, verifications, and other signals to fetch the email address of your target in seconds.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Email Verifier</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-someones-email-by-name-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Email Verifier" /></p>

<p>The Email Verifier feature of Finder.io helps you clean up your database and eliminate invalid email addresses. After you find someone’s email by name, Email Verifier runs a comprehensive email address validation scan to ensure each email in your database is valid, enabling you to send bounce-free emails with full confidence.</p>

<p>It comes with real-time validation with more than 95% accuracy to ensure a specific email exists. You can also try bulk mail list validation to verify a high number of email addresses.</p>

<p>The validations are made at multiple levels, such as format, syntax, domain, and email server response to ensure they are reaching the customer’s inbox. All of this happens with one click of a button, saving you time and boosting open rates.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Finder.io for Chrome Browser</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-someones-email-by-name-4.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Finder.io for Chrome Browser" /></p>

<p>Finder.io comes with a chrome extension feature that helps you find someone’s email by name faster than ever, right from your browser. The feature installs on your browser, saving you time and increasing your workflow. If you install the extension on your browser, you can easily find emails for leads and prospective leads associated with any domain name.</p>

<p>Moreover, the extension also shares the sources of each email address along with its discovery date, compiling invaluable data for future use and optimization. The Chrome extension will automatically search numerous websites to pull email addresses and other contact details. It’s fast and easy.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Bulk Email Finder</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://finder.io/images/blog/find-someones-email-by-name-5.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Bulk Email Finder" /></p>

<p>The Bulk email finder capability is another handy feature of Finder.io that saves a lot of time. You can search or verify email addresses from a number of professionals or for a list of companies in minutes. In order to ensure the accuracy of emails, Finder.io connects to the SMTP server and returns the source of the email.</p>

<p>After a name or domain is entered, Finder.io automatically creates a file full of email addresses from your device or Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.</p>

<h3><strong>6. CRM Integrations</strong></h3>
