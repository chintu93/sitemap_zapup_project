                    <p>You’ve installed the best lead capturing tools on your website and social media. You’ve added lead magnets for better quality leads too. And your email list is growing by the day, which is a good thing.</p>

<p>But your open and click through rates are still stuck on low numbers. </p>

<p>Reason?</p>

<p>It could well be because your hard earned email list, needs some cleaning.</p>

<p>Yes. List cleaning is a whole task in itself and is a very crucial step in email marketing. Having a clean email list is important to fully realize the benefits of email marketing, because sending mails to incorrect, spam or invalid emails may result in bounces and spam traps, all of which will adversely affect your overall email reputation. Your email service provider will end up sending your mails into spam folders or even block your emails altogether. </p>

<p>Especially for small businesses, not making an effort to clean your email list can be quite risky and can hold your entire future at stake.</p>

<p>This is where email verification will help you.</p>

<h1>What is email verification?</h1>

<p>Email verification or email validation is the process of checking whether an email ID is authentic, valid, accurate and deliverable. It involves checking the syntax, the domain, the validity of the address etc. and ensuring that an email to the ID will be delivered promptly. </p>

<p>A good majority of the email addresses that you receive through lead generation techniques like opt in forms or pop ups, for many reasons can be incorrect or invalid. The person entering their email ID could make a manual error, or they may use an email ID that they haven’t realized has gone bad. Or they may not wish to enter the correct ID for personal reasons. All of these can lead to an ineffective email list with addresses that will immensely bring down your deliverability and open rates. </p>

<p>This is precisely why you need to use email verification to clean your email list. It will help you carefully pick out the invalid or incorrect email addresses and ensure that your list contains only valid IDs. You can create a separate list of wrong email IDs to take further action.</p>

<p>Companies typically use bulk email verifier software to clean up their long email lists and maximize the quality of their leads.
