<p>Learn about all the things you should know about App integration workflow software</p>

<h1>Overview of App integration workflow software</h1>

<p>Workflow integration software refers simply to a system that helps to connect with and automate applications and databases of records so as to automate workflow while connecting different applications across the entire organization.</p>

<p><img src="https://flow.ly/images/blog/workflow-software-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="workflow automation software" /></p>

<p>Integrating disparate systems is the biggest barrier to about 52% of marketers with success in marketing technologies I.e they find it hard to make the various marketing apps connect together.</p>

<p>It involves simply the connection of different applications involved in the workflow automation across the application portfolio of any organization. This means ensuring a high level of communication and coordination between all the Saas based application portfolio of the organization I.e there is a transfer of data and information from all the Saas based application in action ranging from AI technologies, external databases, communication APIs, and many other systems that need to be orchestrated in order to work in harmony with each other.</p>

<p>How application integration technology is defined varies amongst organizations, depending on how the data is structured or the case of use, or the various integration tools available to your organization. They all play an important role in how your application would be integrated.</p>

<p>Some businesses might uniquely custom-build a point-to-point integration while others might take an open-source approach and use best practices from developer communities. Still others with the internal resources will make use of an application’s APIs or Web services.</p>

<p>Whether it’s a one-time move of application data, two-way synchronization, or on-demand data processing, and application integration software strategy brings together technologies and services to move relevant information among the software applications and IT systems powering your business. Some of the approaches are:

<p>On-premise application integration</p>

<p>An on-premise application can be a homegrown ERP that you own or another proprietary tool you have bought and that’s used behind your own firewall or in your own “private cloud.” Some traditional approaches to such internal application integration include custom-coding them together but also leveraging an enterprise service bus (ESB), a middleware platform that uses a rules engine to transform and route messages and enable communication between applications.</p>

<p>SaaS application integration</p>

<p>It is obvious that most organizations now use various SaaS applications to manage their businesses. A SaaS CRM like Salesforce or the cloud-based NetSuite ERP are well known as data management tools.  But they must be integrated into your business architecture to avoid data storage and black boxes. A popular cloud integration method is using a pure-play iPaaS solution. These tools rely on single-use API-based integrations, which are often developer-centric and costly.</p>

<p>Application-to-application integration</p>

<p>Most businesses that strive to gain absolute visibility into critical business processes go for application-to-application integration. Let’s say you’re jumping into e-commerce and want to build out a digital store using Magento or Shopify.</p>

<p>Integrating those e-commerce data workflows with your ERP fulfillment processes, which trigger other B2B and EDI data exchange workflows, is vital to ensuring your business can deliver what it just sold. It also provides automation and increases efficiency by removing manual data intervention. Whether it’s a Magento-NetSuite integration or a Salesforce-SAP integration, an ecosystem integration platform streamlines these A2A workflows.</p>

<p>Common examples include <a href="http://github.com/features/actions">GitHub actions</a>, which helps to automate all Software workflows as illustrated in this </p>

<p><img src="https://flow.ly/images/blog/workflow-software-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="workflow automation tool" /></p>

<p>Most organizations utilize application integration softwares to help close the gap between a new cloud application and an older application hosted on-premise, thus ensuring that various applications working perfectly together independently.</p>

<h1>Why do we need Application Integration softwares</h1>

<p>Since all the works and processes of an organization are shared into specific tasks handled by different applications, there is a need to move data between all these applications in a scheduled, ongoing way so much so that a comprehensive system that forms a bridge between applications is formed causing freedom and flexibility. This is the main role which Application integration softwares like <a href="http://flow.ly/">Flow</a> Play in organization via a user-friendly UI as illustrated in this

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>Most workflow automation tools provide a visual drag &amp; drop interface which allows users to define a sequence of steps that are automatically performed by the workflow automation software.</p>

<p>The established sequence then consists of triggers followed by other actions that could further include decision points and schedulers amongst others. The workflows also know as flows are then executed when the triggers are activated.</p>

<p>When a business decides to use application integration, there are some important components that are needed to cause the successful processing amongst plenty applications.  Some of them are:</p>

<p>Application Programming Interface (API)</p>

<p>Application integration is usually done with the use of APIs. An Application Programming Interface has a set of rules that permits the user to communicate with other aspects of an application for their own benefit.</p>

<p>This ensures a seamless usage by the end-user and giving the real producers the opportunity to control their application without any form of hindrance.</p>

<p>Basically, API has established structures in place to aid application integration.</p>

<p>APIs are used to integrate on-premise software systems. With the introduction of web and the development of cloud applications, application integration is now more of an external process. You do not need to have an application stored on your computer for you to be able to access the API of an application.</p>

<p>Application integration software will help you to easily share data among various applications. This will make work easier for employees in a workplace.</p>

<p>An API will help you point out how software components should relate. They allow developers to quickly find benefits of other softwares via clearly defined data structures.</p>

<p>Events and actions</p>

<p>A received payment is an example of an event. An event is any form of happening in your connected application. It is an event that leads to the occurrence of an action. An example of an action of series of actions includes creating, retrieving, or updating datasets.</p>

<p>Data Mapping</p>

<p>Data mapping shows you the particular information exchange that should be utilized.  For instance, if you want to complete and submit contact forms in one application, this event can trigger actions that map those form fields to other corresponding datasets on other applications, categorizing the information entered into first name, last name, status, etc. With this, the process of transferring data is made simple for easy analysis and grouping.</p>

<p><img src="https://flow.ly/images/blog/workflow-software-4.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="workflow tools" /></p>

Errors are reduced to the barest minimum with integration softwares.</p>
