                    <p>We, humans, do multiple things every day. Some of those become our routine. In the business world, business owners are always looking for ways to get the best return on investment (RoI) on these routine tasks. Therefore, businesses always need solutions that can save time while accomplishing these tasks. </p>

<p>These tasks are nothing but workflows and getting them done automatically without human intervention is known as automation. </p>

<p>As you now know what workflow automation is, let’s talk about how to perform the task of workflow automation. To understand the ways to automate workflows, it’s essential that we also focus on what kind of workflows businesses have to deal with. </p>

<p>There are many workflows a business can have in one department. Today, let’s talk about app integration workflows. App integration workflows help you perform repetitive tasks such as sending automatic email responses, adding contacts into the customer relationship management (CRM) software, etc. </p>

<p>Anything which can be predefined on the software front involving multiple apps is known as app integration workflow. Let’s shed some light on what exactly app integration workflows are.</p>

<h3><strong>What are App Integration Workflows</strong></h3>

<p>Nowadays, we are living in a sea of software solutions. They all come with their strengths and weaknesses. But it’s important to note that using one software for every business operation is nearly impossible. </p>

<p>Businesses always rely on multiple applications to get the work done. That’s where the concept of integration comes into the picture. Applications must integrate with other third-party services to ensure that work is not getting stuck anywhere. </p>

<p>App integration workflows deal with the relationship between two apps to perform an action using a trigger and finish the assigned task. Action is the end goal of the workflow or the thing that you want your workflow to accomplish. </p>

<p>Trigger on the other hand is the communication message that is being sent from one app to another to get the action done. This complete process is called an app integration workflow.</p>

<p>App integration workflows are flexible and can be changed according to the action that you want to get done. It can involve two or multiple apps or software solutions. </p>

<p>For example, you want to send an email to customers who signed up for your product. Now you need to integrate your product with an email marketing solution using an app integration platform like Flow.ly. Once done, the email to new customers will always go from your solution once they sign up.</p>

<p>To make this process even faster, you can leverage powerful app integration automation software. Let’s look at the concept.</p>

<h3><strong>What is App Integration Automation Software</strong></h3>

<p>App integration automation software allows you to automate app integration workflows. You create your workflows with this software or can use which comes as pre-defined. </p>

<p>These software solutions like Flow.ly also come with a large gallery of apps that you can use to get your tasks done. You can pick any of the favorite apps from the available options and create your workflow. </p>

<p>This only helps automate repetitive tasks but also improves overall productivity. This becomes highly important for businesses who always want to grow further and focus on team productivity. </p>

<p>These solutions often offer an easy-to-use setup and a drag-and-drop flow builder that can help you create workflows within minutes. This function helps any of the non-technical resources in your team to build workflows and get actions done. </p>
