<p><img src="/images/blog/best-form-builder-tools-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Form builder software" /></p>

<p>For years, online forms have been the go-to tool for businesses and marketers worldwide seeking ways to generate more leads or acquire first-hand user experience from their customers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/customer-service-quotes/">Jodie Shaw</a>, Chief Marketing Officer, The Alternative Board, rightly said, companies should “Always begin with ‘So that I can better serve you, do you mind if I ask a few questions?’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you've probably seen many of these forms on numerous websites, from survey forms to newsletter sign-ups, sales contact forms, and event registration. Online form builders offer unique and easy tools to help you learn more about your target audience or conduct market research for a brand.</p>

<p>With the constantly growing demand for the service, there are now tons of online form builder software suitable for diverse users. However, picking the right builder tool with the appropriate design and structural feature for your business can be incredibly instrumental to achieving optimum value for your intended task.
 This article shares the 10 best form builder tools for 2021, their key features, and pricing.
 But first, let's discuss what a form builder is precisely and the various steps to consider when building an online form.</p>

<h4>What is a Form Builder?</h4>

<p><img src="/images/blog/best-form-builder-tools-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Form creator" /></p>

<p>A form builder is a tool designed to help you collect user information and data via online forms. Most online forms aim to become the perfect lead generator machine for businesses by providing them with actionable data in a logical and meaningful manner.
 Whether you're looking to improve conversion rates, assess customer feedback, or record service information, there is an online form builder that meets your needs.</p>

<h4>Guidelines for Creating the Ideal Online Form</h4>

<p>Here are a few factors to consider when building an online form that works</p>

<ol>
<li><h5>Define the Aim of the Form</h5>

<p>Before creating an online form, you must first determine what the goal of the form will be. Survey form designs are entirely different from that of service subscriptions. Therefore, it is key to the success of your plan that you first identify what type of information you want to collect from your users and then select a form template based on those conditions.</p></li>
<li><h5>Insert Personal Details Field</h5>

<p>For your marketing plan or service feedback to be effective, you need visitors' personal information like individual or organization names. Make sure to include this feature first on your form except for specific surveys where you require users to keep their anonymity.</p></li>
<li><h5>Request Contact Information</h5>

<p>Leads generation is incomplete without any form of follow-up by your sales or marketing team to convert potential customers to profits. However, ensure that you only request information relevant to the service you will be offering. A person signing up for a newsletter or filling a feedback form would be less likely to provide their phone number, and having this as a requirement to submit may invalidate their interest in completing the form.</p></li>
<li><h5>Specify any Additional Information you need</h5>

<p>Additional details like age, employment status, location, and gender will go a long way in helping you make informed decisions based on your audience profile. This information will also provide insights for your marketing team when deciding what kind of product to push into the market and to whom. 
Thankfully, most online form builders provide seamless integration packages that collate your form responses into a simple spreadsheet format for analysis.</p></li>
<li><h5>Setup an Automated Response System</h5>

<p>Take time to create an automatic response message sent every time a visitor fills a form. A simple "Thank you." Or "We appreciate your purchase" goes a long way in certifying your brand as customer-friendly and encouraging users to keep using your service.</p></li>
</ol>
