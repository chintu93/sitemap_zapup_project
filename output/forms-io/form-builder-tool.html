                    <h3>Intro</h3>

<p>Information exchange is the driving force behind everything. The famous scholar “the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing”. I think that’s where forms drew their inspiration.</p>

<p>Through forms you get to know your customers, their expectations and their experiences with your brand. Through forms, you conduct surveys on new concepts as well as old.</p>

<p>Why do you need forms for your business? </p>

<p>Forms are essential to everyday business activities. Acquiring contacts, product enquiries, pre-order forms, delivery information band a whole lot more. 
It is the same for corporate and other teams to keep every activity in record. A robust form builder software is paramount to capture data and maintain existing information. 
Forms are designed to keep information that is related in a central location. It only makes sense to have a database for all the similar forms for easy analysis, reporting, and retrieval.
By nature, forms are used to create local data centers for the subject under study. Analysis of incoming forms sheds light on their effectiveness in the long run. A good form builder software needs to let you in on incoming information so rising concerns are nipped at the bud. </p>

<h3>Coding your forms vs form builder software</h3>

<p>Why form builder software apps are better - they save you time and offer better quality. They are also cheaper. 
Coding requires a budget. And time. You first identify what you want and set out to find a specialist coder in the same. It costs a pretty  penny to get a coder to create forms that are a frequent need in an enterprise.It is not sustainable financially.
Simply put, lets leave coders to handle bigger issues that aren’t just forms, its 2021.</p>

<p>Besides, they put in their expertise in creating form builder softwares. Going to the mall to grab a snack bar is fine, but clinking at a vending machine; way better. Form builder software eliminates the tedious traditional methods and some.
For starters, there are hundreds of softwares to choose from. There is something for everyone; You need allergy information from a party? Create an allergy information form. Just opened a new store? Get organic feedback from customers as they make their first order. While at it, get their contacts for your mail list.
With form builder software, you get flexibility and convenience at the click of an icon.</p>

<h3>So, what does the perfect form builder contain?</h3>

<ol>
<li>Offer the powerful drag and drop feature</li>
</ol>

<p>There is so much information we want to acquire in a single form.  These fields need to be organized with comfort of the respondent in mind. Intuitive flow of questions and field ensures the client doesn’t get irritated or have an incoherent train of thought.</p>

<p>Drag and drop function is easy to use for the creator. It gives creative freedom to experiment with different outcomes in a form. As opposed to coding, this feature breaks the monotony of boring forms with no extra expense.</p>

<ol>
<li>Custom fields</li>
</ol>

<p>A perfect form buil;der should allow you customize each field to fit your imagined vision.  The template of your choice will have some fields you don’t need and leave out others. A Customizing feature will add personality and brand swagger to your forms.  Custom fields are also a differentiating factor for different designers within your firm. They give the space for detailed and practical creative execution.</p>

<ol>
<li>A form builder should have an effective email auto-responder</li>
</ol>

<p>Annual forms are a simple transaction. Issue form, direct the respondent on how they fill out the form, and finally receive the raw information given for analysis.
A builder that lacks an email responder typically withdraws the last step. Knowing when a form has been successfully filled is crucial for targeted campaigns. The volume of forms filled indicates the quality of traffic your site receives and how committed the readers are to your brand.</p>

<ol>
<li>Responsive to multiple devices</li>
</ol>

<p>Ensure that your forms are mobile friendly and work on all devices
Your customer pool is widely variant. People from all walks of life and different choices in information mediums. A perfect form builder should be responsive to all devices available on the market.</p>

<p>Losing out on mobile users is a death wish for any business. Convenience is the name of game. If you are missing out on mobile users, you need to upgrade your form builder software.</p>

<ol>
<li>Easy to embed</li>
</ol>

<p>The forms you create need to embed to your site. This means that it should appear synonymous to what you created on the form builder site. However, this does not mess up your site theme; everything blends in together when properly embedded. </p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/form-builder-tool-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="form creator" /></p>

<ol>
<li>Accepts payments</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe you have encountered payment forms on your mobile apps. A form builder that works for your business should have in it payment systems. It takes a lot to create your product, market and sell to your customers. It only makes sense to have a smooth payment system when the clients makes the decision. It is he goal!
Well a form  builder that supports payment facilitates subscription services; pre order services; and similar models of sales conversions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Integrates with many apps </p>

<p>We are living in a diverse world where there are thousands of applications. You need a form builder app that is not restrictive and one that is compatible with the many applications out there without the need for custom coding. </p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/form-builder-tool-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="forms builder" /></p></li>
</ol>

<p>With a diverse clientele, it is extremely necessary to have multiple channels to provide your services. Your form builder need to bring together rather than diverge your business components.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Multi-page form builders </p>

<p>This is often overlooked in choosing a form builder.
Split your forms into multiple pages and display completion progress bars. In this way, one does not have to get stuck at one question yet there is sufficient information for the questions ahead.</p></li>
<li><p>Save and resume later </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes you are in a hurry to go somewhere or your form creation task may get interrupted - this is why you need a form builder app that auto-saves your work so that you can resume later without losing it. </p>
