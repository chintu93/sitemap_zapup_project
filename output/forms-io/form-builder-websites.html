                    <p>Business is booming, clients are coming in and you have a ton of communication you need to do to close those deals and convert them into actual sales. At this point, handling many clients at the same time is not only overwhelming and can get confusing. There is also the probability that you might overlook some important details in-between the daily hustle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/form-builder-websites-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="form builder" /></p>

<p>Some issues require specific details that are quite impossible to have at your fingertips. Having a database wherein information is preserved for such infrequent demands saves these unique events. </p>

<p>Imagine a former client calls to ask about a delivery that was delivered to a one time address 15 years ago. Having delivery documents from that time means visiting your store for some serious perusals. However, with delivery forms for monthly deliveries on a database, the daunting task is really a breeze.</p>

<p>Form builder websites can well solve your business the burden of space and time. Forms will enable you to create comprehensive, detailed information logs that can be retrieved easily at a future date. One such form builder website is Form .io where you; Create custom forms for all your business needs; Get real time updates on the performance of the forms; Work across various business platforms; and Manage data collected on the forms through an API index both online and offline.</p>

<h3>Common uses of forms include</h3>

<p><strong>Contact forms</strong></p>

<p>Forms are quite popular in collecting email addresses of your site visitors. This is an effective marketing strategy; collected email addresses are used to market offers and notify on new products.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback forms</strong></p>

<p>A simple like, thumbs up or emoji comment does not cut it when you need real feedback from your customers or site visitors. A feedback form is an incognito filter for who the serious customers are. A person that moves past the like button and fills your form is truly interested in the material they receive from your business.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/form-builder-websites-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="forms builder" /></p>
