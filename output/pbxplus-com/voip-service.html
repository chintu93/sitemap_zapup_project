<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">As <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/vint_cerf_238962">Vint Cerf</a> says, “What is special about VOIP is that it's just another thing you can do on the Internet, whereas it is the only thing - or nearly the only thing with the exception of the dial-up modem and fax - that you can do on the public switched telephone network”. All that you need to get going with VOIP service is a computer or a mobile phone with internet access.</span></p>

<h2><strong>What Is VOIP</strong></h2>

<p>VOIP or Voice Over Internet Protocol enables people to make phone calls over the internet cheaply unhindered by geography. It is easy to set up and manage and enables businesses across scale and industry to ramp up their communications efforts.</p>

<p>You could call it a new age way of making phone calls cheaply or even for free. You don’t even need to use a phone in the conventional sense, as you could even use a laptop or a tab to make a call to someone, thanks to VOIP or what is also known as internet telephony.</p>

<h2><strong>Advantages of VOIP</strong></h2>

<p>Not only is VOIP service cheaper than conventional telephony, it provides a slew of business friendly features as well. These include the ability to track call durations, call wait time and hold time as well as a few other useful features. These could be business friendly attributes like call forwarding, call waiting, caller ID and call routing.  It is not surprising to find more and more businesses opting for the more economical and cheaper VOIP service over conventional telephony.</p>

<p>One of the principal reasons for businesses to turn to VOIP in a big way is definitely its low cost. That, as anybody knows, is a huge reason for any business anywhere to adopt it as a surefire way of cutting down the expenses associated with communication,  both within an organization as well as externally. Besides, it offers more features and better calling quality than conventional telephony. As already mentioned you don’t even need to use the conventional way of calling via a telephone handset. There are other cooler ways of making a call.  Isn’t a video call using a computer more exciting and fun than a boring old telephone.? It allows one to communicate and bond that much better. </p>

<h3>Easy Installation and Scaling Up</h3>

<p>The ease with which a VOIP based communication system can be installed as well as scaled up according to requirement is another plus in its favor. Unlike conventional telephone systems, VOIP based telephony is not restricted by geography and national boundaries. This allows even the smallest of businesses to set up the most elaborate international communication network in practically no time whatsoever.</p>

<h3>Multiple Calls</h3>

<p>The way businesses these days scale up in practically no time the ability to manage multiple calls that VOIP enables is a tremendous advantage for any business. The fact that you can do that at no extra cost makes internet telephony that much more viable for a business. That fact that traditional telephone systems require one to lay multiple physical lines invariably increase the line rental cost besides other costs. There is none of that required in the case of a VOIP based system.</p>

<h3>Accessible from Anywhere</h3>

<p>Unlike traditional telephony a person’s physical location is no longer an impediment to communicating cheaply anywhere across the globe, from wherever one might be. One could be in the office, in a subway train, commuting by bus or  traveling in a car somewhere, as long as one has an internet connection.</p>

<p>This universal accessibility that VOIP telephony enables is a tremendously empowering feature that businesses across industry and scale can leverage to their advantage. This is particularly a very useful feature for startups who cannot afford a network of offices or have a large staff to back them up.</p>

<h3>International Connectivity at No Extra Cost</h3>

<p>Business these days is not confined to a single market and often is carried out on an international scale. That being stated it is important that one is able to communicate unimpededly internationally without paying a fortune to enable that. That is exactly what VOIP enables, allowing one to communicate with one’s suppliers or clients conveniently as well as cheaply.  That apart, one can make and receive calls from any corner of the world at no extra cost. </p>

<h2><strong>Why VOIP is Important</strong></h2>

<p>VOIP is important because it frees businesses across scale of the shackles of poor infrastructure and enables them to step up to the plate and communicate freely with wherever their target market may be. For small businesses and startups where a penny saved is literally a penny earned, a VOIP based communications system is literally a life saver. </p>
