                    <p>Productivity is key to getting the most out of your employees, accomplishing tasks and successfully completing projects. A time tracking app is a significant motivator for employees and peace of mind for employers. </p>

<p>In going into remote mode of operations, a lot of difficulties and challenges arise that would not have been experienced before and a result, the organization would not have made ample preparations for. Issues like "Do we know how long each employee worked for today?", "Could we know the correct amount of time they spent working on certain projects?". These and more questions, which the management would not have a direct answer to, will become the order of the day. Asking the employees to submit a daily report would not give an accurate representation, as some would not send it in simply because they were too busy, and the danger of falsified reports is rather high. Also, on management's part, the question that arises is that are they paying the employees enough for the work that they are doing and the amount of time that they put in?</p>

<p>To really resolve this issue, an impartial third party is needed. This is where these time tracking apps come in. They offer solutions to the following needs or problems:</p>

<h3><strong>Problem #1: Inaccurate time sheet / poor record keeping.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> They provide an accurate real-time online timesheet.</p>

<h3><strong>Problem #2: Keeping track of employees’ progress and workload.</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Problem #3: Keeping track of resources spent on creating a new product, feature or marketing campaign.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Some of these time tracking apps offer task-time tracking to improve your project managing.</p>

<h3><strong>Problem #4: Being unable to really see what your employees are doing due to remote working conditions.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> They provide you with employee monitoring services.</p>

<h3><strong>Problem #5: Organizations want to pay their employees for the time they have actually worked.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> They also offer payroll services integrated into the app.  </p>

<p>These and more are the reasons why you need a top time tracking app for your business or organization.</p>

<p>According to AppointmentPlus, managing time efficiently results in the ability to accomplish more with less effort by learning to take control of your time and ability to focus.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is Time Tracking?</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://clockly.com/images/blog/time-tracking-trackly.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="What is time tracking" /></p>

<p>Time tracking software gives organizations the ability to track the amount of time that their employees have worked, and it also gives employees the ability to track their own time without having to pay too much attention to when they started and stopped working.</p>

<p>Time tracking software has had a significant impact on a company's ability to hire employees that aren't necessarily onsite or to give freedom to employees to work remotely outside the office.</p>

<p>With the more efficient time tracking apps, you can track which projects are going to go over budget or which employees aren’t working to their full potential. Some even track when employees are active and not active by tracking keystrokes and mouse movements.</p>
