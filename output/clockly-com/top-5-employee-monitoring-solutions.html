                    <p>Productivity is almost universally recognized as <em>the</em> key benchmark in business. In fact, productivity is used to measure success in almost every area of life.</p>

<p>One of the reasons productivity is so closely studied in the business world, and elsewhere, is that it’s super easy to correlate productivity and success no matter what criteria you use to define success.</p>

<p>For example, if you define success as more sales, you can boost productivity and acquire more sales. As a concept, it doesn’t get any simpler than that. As a concept, more productivity equals more positive results.</p>

<p>The confusion begins when you break through the surface and ask "how?"</p>

<p>You need more productivity out of your employees, but <em>how</em> do you challenge them and bring them outside their comfort zones without breaking their spirit? Social media expert and CMO influencer Jeff Bullas explained that everyone has a breaking point.</p>

<p><strong>"For most people, there is a limit to which they can stretch themselves. After that, you are bound to break down. The huge burden of unfinished tasks takes a toll on your relationships as well as your physical and mental health."</strong></p>

<p>The answer is data.</p>

<p>You need to be able to identify opportunities for growth and nudge employees along the path to more productivity. You need data to identify bottlenecks in productivity, to highlight strengths and weaknesses among your staff, and to make data-driven decisions in general.</p>

<p>Data is the lifeblood of your workflow, and the best way to collect the kind of data you need to boost employee productivity is to take advantage of employee monitoring solutions like the ones listed below.</p>
