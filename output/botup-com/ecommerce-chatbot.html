                    <p>The unrelenting cutthroat competition in the business environment means that brands have to stand out from the rest. Due to stringent regulations, we see brands offering quality services and products, further stiffening the competition. Product and service designers are thus working day and night to make their products and services more sophisticated with each passing day. In light of this, consumers are truly spoilt for choice.</p>

<p>In such a scenario, customer experience becomes the determining factor and it is no wonder that it has become a top priority for many organizations. </p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white"><strong><em><a href="https://www.pointillist.com/blog/report-customer-journey-management-cx-measurement/">Data</a> from Pointillist shows that 87% of marketers and customer experience professionals believe that customer experience is extremely important for their business.</em></strong> </span></p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed digital acceleration and as businesses move online, it is important that they strategically rethink their customer experience if they are to survive. </p>

<p><strong>*Innovator and venture capitalist Johnny Waterschoot argues that “As the pandemic rages on, investors who recognize CX as a lever for long-term value creation have a unique opportunity to drive differentiation and customer loyalty.” *</strong>

<p>We agree. In our view, you can use chatbots to streamline your customer experience by improving communication with your clients and thereby generate more sales as well as build a strong rapport with them.</p>

<h2>What is a chatbot?</h2>

<p>A chatbot is software that automates messaging through the use of artificial intelligence and coding. It is a virtual assistant used to simulate human conversation. Chatbots are programmed to perceive phrases and keywords which will then trigger a desired response. The bots get better over time by responding to clients and thus self-learning. More advanced bots can even respond to spoken words. eCommerce businesses use Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Slack chatbots. You will need a chatbot builder to kickstart your journey.</p>

<h2>Advantages of using chatbots</h2>

<p><strong>*According to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/offer/digital-trends-2020.html">recent research</a> by Adobe, 41% of leading businesses were already using artificial intelligence in 2020 for everything from suggesting keywords and simplifying scheduling to flagging potential fraud. *</strong></p>

<p>The advantage of automation is that it enables businesses to free up resources, human or otherwise so that they can focus on strategy and creativity. 
Here are some of the tasks that eCommerce chatbots can handle for eCommerce businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Answers FAQs</strong>: Brands can program their chatbots to answer frequently asked questions.</p>

<p><strong>Saves time and money</strong>: Chatbots can give customers 24/7 support and engagement. By so doing, eCommerce businesses don’t have to pay overtime to employees. </p>

<p><strong>Boosts sales</strong>: Chatbots are capable of sorting clients’ queries and sending them to the most relevant person to deal with them. It helps to avoid conventional means where clients could be sent from one teller to the next. Travel agencies can use bots to help their clients book flights, reserve hotels, and hire cars. Retailers can use chatbots to track shipments or take orders and handle customer service.</p>

<p><strong>Provides quick response</strong>: Clients want immediate response to their queries and if they don’t get it, they jump to the next business. Chatbots give immediate and accurate responses thus customers do not have to wait long to get replies. This efficiency creates customer satisfaction and thus enhancing engagement. Engaged clients are more likely to buy your merchandise and be your brand ambassadors.</p>

<p><strong>Reduces human error</strong>: If well-programmed, chatbots increase efficiency by providing accurate and timely information.</p>

<p><strong>Improves customer loyalty</strong>: Chatbots can store a wide pool of data about your product, organization, and clients. With this information, it helps to personalize users’ on-site journey. Personalization excites customers and they are thus likely to come back as they already have a relationship with your brand and they know that you know what they want, how they want it, and where they want it.</p>

<p><strong>Work automation</strong>: Did you know that some chatbot builders come with additional features? Botup, for example, allows you to deploy messenger bots on your Slack workspaces to automate repetitive tasks and let your teams focus on what matters the most.</p>

<h2>Designing a chatbot</h2>

<p>Instituting a chatbot to reach out to your clients will help you save time, increase effectiveness, and ensure customer satisfaction. Here are simple tips on how to design a proficient chatbot.</p>

<p><strong>•        Select the platform you want to work with.</strong> The right platform will help you create a bot that has more chances of being effective with no downtime.</p>

<p><strong>•        Define the goals you want to achieve with the chatbot</strong>. It could be nurturing leads, using it as your first line of communication, answering FAQs, or even market and sell products. Your focus should be on what the clients want and how they get the most out of your operation.</p>

<p><strong>•        Decide on the type of information to fish from your clients.</strong> What type of data do you intend to gather from your customers? It could be ID numbers, names, location, age, sex, email address, among other relevant data to ensure you can provide effective services. This information helps you to segment your clients and thus offering each segment exactly what they would buy.</p>

<p><strong>•        Create a natural conversational flow.</strong> Yes, you are using artificial intelligence, but you do not want your clients to know they are conversing with a chatbot. When designing your conversational flow, ensure you incorporate tone and personality that would look natural and humanlike. Decide on how informal or formal you want to be. Make it look like you are the one handling the conversations personally. Consider the questions your clients might ask, the phrases they might use, and what information you will gather from them.</p>

<p><strong>•        Start small and simple.</strong> Chatbots are a work in progress and get better and better over time. While designing your bot, do not overcomplicate things, start small since you can always top up information anytime. To make it look more realistic, use emotions in your conversation by adding GIFs and emojis.</p>

<p><strong>•        Tweak regularly.</strong> Often checking and evaluating your chatbot would help determine if it is working as intended. Test the options you have to find which will suit your goals more. Ask customers easy questions about your layout, tone, voice, or procedures and tweak them to suit them and you.</p>

<p><strong>•        Respond quickly to live messages</strong> and ensure it is easy to switch from bot to human support. There are instances when inquiries fall outside the automated sequence, or a bot transfers the client to speak with you. To gain your client's trust and build loyalty, it is prudent to answer these calls immediately.</p>

Bots allow you to send marketing information regularly to only interested clients who have joined your chat.

<p><strong>9.        Proactively engage with visitors.</strong> Brands can design chatbots welcome messages that are friendly and contains basic information about the brand and its products.

<p><strong>10.         Providing 24/7 support</strong>. Clients may send inquiries outside business or operational hours.

With chatbots, this is no longer the issue since they are programmed to respond immediately at any time of the day or night.</p>

<p><strong>11.         Route inquiries to customer service agents.</strong> If a query is not resolved by the bot, there is a means where the client gets referred to an individual agent. Most of the conversation is handled by the chatbot thus saving the agent’s time. </p>
