                    <p>As a small business owner interested in streamlining marketing or customer service, using a chatbot should be something that’s worth taking a closer look at. Here's why...</p>

<p>Technological advancements have disrupted customer service through digital channels. Nowadays, customers demand instantaneous interactions and there is no other option but chatbots. According to Gartner, in 2020, customers will manage 85% of their relationships with a company without human interaction. This trend shows that customer service is transforming at a pace unimaginable and companies need to start leveraging chatbots in businesses to deliver extraordinary customer experiences and meet consumer expectations. </p>

<p>Chatbots aren’t exactly a new phenomenon. They’ve been around for decades in one form or another. </p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">According to Kelly Noble Mirabella, from <a href="https://spiderworking.com/blog/2019/03/26/kelly-noble-mirabella-chatbots/">Spiderworking</a>, "Ironically, a lot of people think that they’ve never used a chatbot, they’ve never experienced it, when in fact they have. Because Siri and Google and Alexa and all those voice-activated speaking bots, if you will, are actually audio chatbots."</span></p>

<p>Yet the last couple years have ushered in a new wave of chatbots that take their functionality to all new levels. If you’re a small-business owner interested in streamlining marketing or customer service, then using a chatbot is something that’s worth taking a closer look at.</p>

<p>But the problem is, most small businesses aren’t really aware of how a chatbot can help them grow their customer management. Let’s dive in to see what is a chatbot, explore its applications in business and more.</p>

<h3>About Chatbots?</h3>

<p>So, what exactly are chatbots? A chatbot is an automated system of communication that can instantly communicate with clients or visitors on a website. Most chatbots use a chat interface for communication.</p>

<p>They’re compatible with all the major chat message interfaces, including Facebook Messenger, Slack, WhatsApp, and more. They can also be designed specifically for use with private chat or messaging services. Chatbots are governed by a predetermined set of rules. The best of the best combine these rules with artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>In other words, these chatbots can actually relay complex information and make informed decisions instead of just spitting out the same information over and over again.</p>

<p>So what are chatbots used for? Typically, for businesses at least, they are used for functions such as customer service, generating new leads, and making the sales process easier. However, new chatbots are being introduced all the time that help customers with all sorts of different problems.</p>

<h3>How to Tell if A Chatbot is Right for Your Business</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure if a chatbot is necessary for your business, ask yourself if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a messaging strategy in place, or do you receive the same questions over and over again from prospects or existing customers?</li>
<li>Your audience technologically adept enough to embrace a chatbot?</li>
<li>You have the resources available to set up a chatbot and monitor how it performs?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you answered “yes” to all those questions, your business would probably benefit from having a chatbot. </p>

<h2>Benefits of Using a Chatbot App</h2>

<p>There’s a reason so many businesses, both large and small, have jumped on chatbot apps and technology. And the reason is that chatbot apps bring about a variety of important benefits.</p>

<h4>1. Growing the Business</h4>

<p>Chatbot apps enable small businesses without extensive resources to find new leads, convert customers, and provide better customer service by creating chatbots. Gone are the days where customers would wait for you to respond. With so much competition, customers often get in touch with multiple businesses at the same time and you have to race against time to be the first to  respond to win the customer. With chatbots, you can do this easily. The  visitors on your website or other online platforms will automatically  get answers to all their questions during the customer journey process.  This will help the customers to make informed decisions resulting in  better user experience and increased brand loyalty.</p>

<h4>2. Less Time/Less Money</h4>

<p>Chatbot apps are an affordable means of providing a better customer experience. They don’t take time away from otherwise busy employees and don’t cost much money to use. By implementing chatbots in small or medium-sized businesses, you can cut down the expenses of hiring multiple customer service  representatives. Chatbots are available 24/7 and never get tired of  responding to customer queries; hence you won’t have to worry about  training the resources or hire more employees when your customer base  grows. This makes chatbots a sustainable solution for small businesses.</p>

<h4>3. Cheap/Easy</h4>

<p>To build a basic bot through a chatbot app is remarkably easy and affordable. </p>

<h4>4. Simple Interface</h4>

<p>Chatbot apps are easy for customers to use. Design yours with a simple interface to make interaction a breeze.</p>

<h4>5. Forefront of Technology</h4>

<p>There’s no denying that they are going to be an online business standard in the next few years. Incorporating them into your small business plan now ensures you’ll be at the forefront of this technology.</p>

<p>Chatbots aren’t without their fair share of problems. Yet many of these problems stem from the fact that the  technology is still relatively new. In other words, changes are always being made to improve chatbots. The main issue small business owners want to look out for is sacrificing authenticity by using chatbots. Rely too much on the technology, and you lose that face-to-face, person-to-person feeling of customer interactions. For small businesses, building an authentic brand and creating solid  relationships with your audience is beyond important. Don’t let your  chatbot take away from that.</p>

<h2>How Small Businesses Can Use A Chatbot App</h2>

<p>You now know how chatbot apps benefit small businesses. But how do you actually use them?</p>

<p>The top ways to effectively use chatbot apps to grow your small business include:</p>

<h4>1. Customer Resource</h4>

<p>Chatbots are a lot smarter than most people assume. For example, they  actually remember the information users tell them. They’re able to learn this information and use it to better help future users. Use it as a  frontline customer resource, especially to field basic questions and  concerns.</p>

<h4>2. Simplify Sales</h4>

<p>In addition to providing information, chatbots influence sales. The best bots created with top chatbot apps, automate the sales process to streamline it from start to finish.  Use a bot to simplify sales on both ends of the equation, for the customer and your small business.</p>

<h4>3. Influence Decisions</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, most small businesses don’t have the resources to give every new customer one-on-one attention. That’s where chatbot apps come into the picture yet again. These bots can make recommendations for users based on a variety of data gathered from simple questions and  previous interactions. Chatbots free up company time while providing a dynamic new form of 24/7 sales support.</p>

<h4>4. Increase Engagement</h4>

<p>Facebook has recently opened the gates to its Messenger platform. The changes allow businesses to use chatbot apps within this service. Not only  does this help with improving customer service and boosting sales, it  also directly correlates to increased customer engagement on this social media platform. Use a well-developed chatbot to drive new users to your small business social media accounts.</p>

<h4>5. Streamline Payments</h4>

<p>The latest and greatest chatbot apps use features that allow them to act as a streamlined payment system. Customers can actually pay for their  products without ever leaving the chat interface. Bots that store  payment details of regular customers make ordering new products or  services as easy as a click of the button.</p>

<h4>6. Answer Questions</h4>

<p>Perhaps the easiest and most popular way to use a chatbot app for your small business is to answer basic customer questions. A chatbot loaded with  FAQs is often very effective at providing sufficient answers to customer queries, especially in fields that use a lot of specific jargon. Use a chatbot to weed out basic customer questions from the pack before  directing customers to a live representative.</p>
