<h2>Chatbots explained</h2>

<p>Chatbots are used to simulate conversations between brands and clients and aid in giving customers information about the business and its product. Chatbots are programmed to spot keywords or phrases in questions and then send accurate and immediate response to the inquiry.</p>

<p>Chatbots can be integrated into websites or messaging applications like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Telegram, enabling you to build a long-lasting relationship with your clients all over the globe, offer personalized engagement with clients improving the probability they would be converted and instituting intelligent conversations to answer inquiries and generate leads.</p>

<p>Chatbot builders, design chatbots for different reasons depending on the client's request and preferences. For instance, chatbots could be used to conduct sales operations, could be a marketer, customer service agent, or first-line communication channel. Customer service operations can use chatbots to resolve client’s inquiries thus freeing up time for agents to concentrate on other intricate jobs that require a human touch.</p>

<p>There are different types of technology that chatbot builders use depending on the requirements of the clients.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Simple chatbot software.</strong> It uses a rules-based conversational interface that engages in basic conversational exchange. In this type of software, clients select a specific question to ask which is then immediately responded to by the chatbot. These chatbots are a great option for organizations handling a large pool of routine customer inquiries. The biggest downside is that they can’t handle nuanced or complex queries. However, they can be programmed to send these questions to the nearest available human agent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Virtual assistant software.</strong> This type of technology takes chatbots to the next level. They do not rely on a simple rule-based interface but on artificial intelligence technology to reply to customer questions in a personalized way. These bots utilize machine learning and natural language processing technology to learn from all niches overtime to give prospects and customers much better and contextual replies.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Conversational AI Platforms.</strong> This software allows users to design their chatbot as it comes with tools for such design and a pre-designed chatbot. This allows brands to create a chatbot geared to serve their business and industry. However, building an individual chatbot may require hiring an expert which small organizations may not afford. Each technology has its benefits, so it is important to consider the needs of your business. Consider these factors before investing in chatbot software.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the type of chatbot technology needed by your brand? Are you going to design your chatbot and conversational assistant or do you require a pre-designed chatbot? If you are looking for a pre-designed bot, would a simple rule-based chatbot suit your brand or would a chatbot geared by ML and NLP technology?</p></li>
<li><p>If you are looking to purchase a chatbot with AI assistants - for sales, or higher education, or marketing, or customer service, or whichever the purpose -, look for vendors who have created AI assistants for that purpose specifically.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide which chatbot software suits your budget. Simple rule-based platforms are relatively cheaper while those geared by ML and NLP technology are expensive, but conversational platforms maybe even a bigger budget constraint. Prices vary depending on the number of virtual assistants needed, chatbot technology, and software complexities.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p><strong>Keep it real and engaging.</strong> Avoid too many technical terms but use more slang and colloquial terms. Engage as if you are conversing with a friend or family. Use emojis, GIFs to create emotional scenarios in the flow to look more engaging, intuitive, and real.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate and tweak your chatbot regularly.</strong> To achieve the intended level of efficiency, generate a regular report on its performance. It could be through asking clients to give feedback on their efficacy. Use this report to tweak and tweak till you achieve proficiency.</p></li>
