<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">Messenger bots are the current craze and with good cause. Facebook Messenger bots are transforming businesses right now. They’ve changed the marketing game entirely and they wield enormous power for whatever business you’re in. CEO of Tesla, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/323278">Elon Musk</a> was right on track when he said,"The pace of progress in artificial intelligence is incredibly fast."</span></p>

<h2>What is a Facebook Messenger Bot?</h2>

<p>A Messenger bot is basically simulating a conversation and gives pre-written replies people can choose from, or it’s waiting for a specific input. Bots can help you to generate leads, deliver lead magnets, and build 1:1 relationships by providing a lot of value.</p>

<h2>Why Facebook Messenger?</h2>

<p>Messenger is the #1 app in the US and Canada with over 1 billion active users. It’s also one of the most engaging channels with an average open rate of 80%. And click-through rates that are up to 10 times higher compared to email.</p>

<h2>What to Use Facebook Messenger Bots For</h2>

<p>You can use a Facebook Messenger Bot for a lot of things. But we can basically divide them into 3 categories.</p>

<p>1) Marketing
2) Sales
3) Support</p>

<h2>The 10 Biggest Facebook Messenger Bot Mistakes</h2>

<h3>1. Failing to plan properly</h3>

<p>As with any technology trend, there must be a strategic reason for introducing the new technology to your business. Adopting technology for the sake of it can be costly and counter-productive. Knowing what goal and metrics you’re targeting will help you hone in on  the right audience, design the right bot functionality and experience, and ultimately guide your users to performing the key interactions that  drive your bottom line.</p>

<h3>2. Not creating a dedicated bot website</h3>

<p>A dedicated landing page for your Messenger bot gives users the option to first read and understand your distinct value add. Without the introduction, you’re leaving them to deduce your functionality by themselves. </p>

<p>The benefits of a dedicated website are clear:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unifies access to your bot on a single page, which is especially important if  your bot runs on multiple platforms or can be accessed different ways</li>
<li>Builds SEO strength and an identity separate from the platforms. For example, a Google search for “Hi Poncho”, the Facebook weather app, will lead you  to their website where you can easily add Poncho to your Messenger or  Slack system.</li>
<li>Shares more about your product, links to additional information and press, and increases perceived legitimacy of your bot, brand, or business</li>
<li>Simplifies linking to and sharing your bot as site URLs are more shareable than bot access directions</li>
<li>Allows press, fans and users to contact you easily</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Not listing in bot directories</h3>

<p>Discoverability is very challenging for a Messenger bot. Other than Telegram, none of the current chatbot platforms have robust search functionalities. In the meantime, 3rd party lists and directories are being built to fill this void.</p>

<h3>4. Vague and uninformative descriptions</h3>

<p>As with any other product description, how you describe your bot will either inspire or discourage users to engage. Bot reviews and rating systems are few and far between, so your description is key to your bot being discovered, understood, and adopted. Make your bot’s functionality and utility abundantly clear for your target users.</p>

<h3>5. Not having a unique and findable bot name</h3>

<p>Your Messenger bot name is one of the the only pieces of information, other than your icon and short description, that potential users see and use to decide whether to try you out. Furthermore, if your bot name is too generic, users might not be able to find you at all. This problem is particularly exacerbated on messaging platforms like  Facebook that lump bots together in search results with real people, business, pages, and other content.</p>

<p>So, make sure your bot name is easy to spell, pronounceable, and ideally at the beginning of the alphabet. Also try to avoid any brand and  trademarked names as that may get you in legal trouble.</p>

<p><img src="https://botup.com/images/blog/messenger-bot-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="messenger bot" /></p>

<h3>6. Not clarifying that your bot is not a human</h3>

<p>Currently on Facebook Messenger, search results lump Bots &amp; Businesses together into one category, meaning a user can’t be sure if they’re messaging the human owners of a business, or an automated bot, or even just a random person with the misfortune of having a name identical to your bot name. </p>

<p>Facebook may fix this in the future with a clearer designation, but for  now you should distinguish your bot from humans by either adding “Bot”  or “Assistant” to the bot name or by having your bot clarify its role when starting a conversation with users.</p>

<h3>7. Not performing robust user tests before launch</h3>

<p>As with any product development, the first few iterations of your Messenger bot will likely have bugs or unexpected UX issues. Invite existing users to beta test your bot and share feedback. Users will feel privileged and you’ll get extremely insightful information. Treat this bot launch as you would any other product build complete with user research, testing, feedback, and constant iterations.</p>

<h3>8. Not leveraging existing users for promotion</h3>

<p>Existing users aren’t just great for early feedback. They are often your greatest advocates since they’re already fans of your brand or business.</p>

<p>Engage your most excited existing users with your Messenger bot, pay careful attention to their usage and feedback, and include in your marketing plan ways for them to easily share, use, and promote your bot with their friends.</p>

<h3>9. Being overly pushy or spammy</h3>

<p>Messaging is an intimate act. People are used to messaging with friends, family, and loved ones. When inserting bots into the same platforms as these highly personalized conversations, there’s risk of businesses exploiting the interaction by overdoing sales offerings and spammy promotions.</p>

<p>Pushy bots are not only a marketing nuisance for users, they’re also prone to being banned. For example, if enough users report your bot as spam,  Facebook will automatically pull you from the Messenger platform.</p>

<p>To reduce the "spamminess" of your Messenger bot, respond only when users have  proactively reached out. Resist the temptation to send unsolicited  messages just because you have a one-to-one channel open with your  audience.</p>

<h3>10. Trying to go too broad and losing focus</h3>

<p>There’s no need to make a bot for an entire brand immediately. You’re better off building a Messenger bot for a single campaign or focused purpose. Trying to do too much with a bot usually leads to confused users, lack  of adoption, and ultimately poorer results for your business and brand.</p>

<h2>Ways to Use Facebook Messenger Bots to Increase Conversions</h2>

<p>More than 20 billion messages are  exchanged between business and users monthly on Facebook Messenger.  Through answering questions and performing most of the preliminary work  usually performed through customer service staff, now a Messenger bot can help  to ease the buying process and increase conversation that will be  beneficial for your company.</p>

<p>If you do Facebook marketing for increasing your conversion rate, then a Messenger bot is the must-have tool for you. Let’s see how chatbot serves your business at its best.</p>

<h4>1. Improve customer service</h4>

<p>The first way to use Messenger bots to increase conversions is obvious: Through the use of automated messaging, you are guaranteed to provide potential customers with an immediate response to any questions they may have.</p>

<p>Providing excellent customer services is crucial to upping your conversion rates <em>and</em> sets you apart from the competition. When building your chatbot, make  sure you take into consideration FAQs sent to your business and provide a means through which people can quickly find answers to them. The  easiest way to do this is to offer multiple choice responses that  gradually narrow down to a specific question. </p>

<p>By ensuring that you are providing high-quality  answers, potential customers can quickly and easily decide if they wish  to purchase your products or services. Not only does the relaying of  accurate and precise information play to your favor, but by providing an immediate response you are reducing the chances of these people  sourcing an alternative supplier or buying from someone with a quicker  response rate. </p>

<h4>2. Build brand awareness</h4>

<p>Use your bot to let people know what it is your  company does, particularly when communicating with people who have  recently entered your brand’s sphere of influence. This is a great way  to capture interest. By conveying your brand in a way that appeals to  your target audience, you are qualifying people from a cold audience to a warm audience and moving them down your sales funnel. There are a few  ways to do this, and there’s no reason that you can’t do them all. It’s  all about what works best for your brand.</p>

<h4>3. Encourage people to visit your product page</h4>

<p>Once you’ve used one or both of the above features to warm your audience up, you can start directing them to your product pages. However, it is important that you make it feel natural and conversational and not like a sales pitch. If you don’t want to direct people to your product pages this way, you can always add a shop button to the menu, but well-organized conversation does tend to work well. </p>

<h4>4. Send broadcasts to subscribers to increase your customer lifetime value</h4>

<p>As well as your standard bot conversation, you can  send out ad hoc broadcasts to your subscribers. There are many useful  ways to use these to draw attention back to your brand and increase  customer lifetime value and the likelihood of future conversions. Once  again, make sure that these aren’t too sales orientated and send them  out sparingly – no more than once per week.</p>

<p>You can use broadcasts to let customers know about  important business news you think they will find interesting, to offer  them content that they may find useful such as a blog which will draw  them back to your website, or to ask them if they want to be made aware  of future product launches and information. </p>

<p>With broadcasts, it’s important not to bombard  people with information but to engage them in a conversation. Try asking questions to see if they are interested and wish to continue. You  should also offer multiple opportunities to end the conversation if they aren’t interested. </p>

<h4>5. Include augmented reality</h4>

<p>Victoria Beckham is one of the few people to embrace augmented reality as part of her chatbot, and the results are seriously impressive. She's owner of one of the best Facebook Messenger bots we've seen. She uses it to allow users to use their camera try on her collection of sunglasses to see whether or not they would suit them. This is a great way to encourage conversions, which we are hoping to see more of in the future. For more information on her bot you can check out this case study. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Facebook Messenger bots are a friendly and accessible time-saver for customers. And for businesses, they’re a cost-efficient way to scale customer support and marketing automation. </p>

<p>Messaging platforms have exceeded social networks in popularity and engagement, so chatbot developers and marketers need to learn how to be successful in these environments.
