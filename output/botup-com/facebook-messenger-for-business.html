<p>Facebook messenger for business allows businesses to reach out to their prospects and existing clients. With chatbots, businesses can automate tasks thus freeing up time for other equally important tasks. A chatbot allows organizations to reply to inquiries any time of the day (24/7) thus creating convenience for brands with limited staff and time. </p>

<p>There are two types of chatbots; AI-powered chatbots and the other searches for information from a database. The former utilizes artificial intelligence and user interfaces to give the client a two-way conversation. Here, a bot can recognize a new pattern in the data and store the information. Furthermore, it can identify speech rhythms and emulate human conversation.</p>

<p>The second type searches for data from a database. For instance, a coffee shop chatbot can aid clients to do their purchases with no need of using artificial intelligence. The bot gives clients options; Espresso, Latte, Mocha, or Cappuccino, with a list of variations such as large or small, from a database containing the information. Price and payment mode are then displayed depending on the choice made. If the user had done the process before, credit card information was then stored, and the job is completed. The robot will look for pre-registered data while the chatbot smooth runs the sales procedure.</p>

<p><img src="https://botup.com/images/blog/facebook-messenger-for-business-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="facebook messenger for business tool" /> </p>

<p><strong>1. Leverage a proper chatbot tool such as Botup</strong>
To ensure more success in creating a chatbot platform that actually works with great efficiency, then you need a proper tool. Most of these tools will guide you through the design process from start to finish. We cannot emphasize enough the need of using a reliable chatbot tool.</p>

<p><strong>2. Define your goals and expectations</strong>
You should have a specific purpose for the chatbot you are devising. Your focus should be on what your clients desire and how you can benefit them with your services or product. A bot could only be efficient if you instruct it well with relevant information. Platforms help you design a chatbot that lets you have a full conversation with your clients, but it is more proficient if you add information about tasks, conversation flows, clients' personalized data among other relevant data you choose. </p>

<p>Outline clearly what it is you want to achieve with your chatbot, whether you want it to answer customer inquiries, or you plan to use it as your first line of communication, nurturing leads, or even marketing and selling your products. It's crucial to have your goals clearly stated before going to the next step. It would improve the brands' responsiveness and ease of creating a successful chatbot.</p>

<p><strong>3. Define the kind of information to collect from your clients</strong>
Outline the type of data you wish to gather when engaging with your clients through the chatbot to achieve better customer service delivery. Information such as names, phone numbers, ID numbers, email addresses, and order numbers can help you raise your proficiency in service delivery. Understanding your customers will help you give them exactly what they need and by so doing, giving them satisfaction and improving their loyalty to your brand.</p>

<p><strong>4. Design a chatbot conversation flow that is natural</strong>
You do not want your clients to feel like they are chatting with robots. When creating a flow for your chat, design a human-like and natural flow to the interaction. The conversation could be a welcome message, offering support, marketing a product or service, nurturing leads, or gathering information about your clients. Determine the flow then start designing your chatbots brand.</p>

<p><strong>5. Define personality and tone</strong>
Create a tone and personality that will bring a human-like interaction to get more engagement. Make it look like you are the one personally handling the conversation. The speech pattern should not at all sound like you are using artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><strong>6. Keep it short and sweet</strong>
Avoid overcomplicating things by starting small and simple. The good thing is you can always add more and thus, you should not overthink and just design a chatbot that is more engaging, intuitive, and more humanlike than botlike. Most clients are getting the messages through their phones, so it is crucial to keep the messages short. Ask questions that clients can reply to in a few words or one click.</p>

<p><strong>7. Keep it real</strong>
This will help to ensure the chatbot is engaging and intuitive. Avoid words that are technical and jargon. Consider what questions your clients might inquire, the phrases they might use in those questions, what information you will have to collect to help them among other relevant data. </p>

<p>This information will help you create a flowchart that would help everyone achieve their desired goal. It should be casual and engaging like conversing with a friend or family. Use GIFs or emojis to give a realistic appearance, and also allow them to respond more regularly to keep them engaged. Use less formal language, and if possible, include slang terms, emojis, and colloquial language.</p>

<p><strong>8. Add emotions to your conversations</strong>
To make your chatbot more realistic and with human-like touch, including emotions in your flow is crucial. Using images and GIFs could help improve emotional intelligence. This would also make the conversation more engaging.</p>

<p><strong>9. Evaluate and optimize your chatbot frequently</strong>
If you want to provide more value when interacting with your clients, then you have to understand that chatbots are a work in progress. Observe how your customers are using the chatbot and adjust where required as time goes. Test different options and tweak according to which will work best. You could frequently ask your clients to give feedback on issues like wording, tone, voice, or layouts among other areas. Regularly generate reports on the performance of your chatbot.</p>

<p><strong>10. Make it easy to switch from chatbot to human support</strong>
Allow your customers to reach human assistance whenever possible. When the queries are transferred from the automated sequence, it is prudent to reply to them as fast as possible. This will aid in building a long-lasting relationship with prospects and customers. Share information about your brand as regularly as possible to keep them in the know so that they would feel they are part of your brand.</p>
