<p>The AI revolution is here with us and businesses, no matter their size, are embracing it to the fullest and are reaping its benefits which include revenue generation and cost reduction as a result of automation. </p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">The <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/global-survey-the-state-of-ai-in-2020">2020 McKinsey Global Survey</a> on artificial intelligence (AI) shows that organizations are using AI as a revenue generation tool. According to the survey, some companies attributed 20 percent or more of their organizations’ earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to AI. “These companies plan to invest even more in AI in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its acceleration of all things digital,” reads part of the report.</span></p>

<p>It is no wonder then that AI has infiltrated almost all the departments that you may think of in a company. As businesses are looking for ways to stay ahead of the pack while offering their customers a top-notch customer experience, they seem to have found a balance with chatbots – software applications that simulate human interaction.</p>

<p>If your brand has a website or social media platform, then a chatbot will be your way to refine your customer experience. Clients could easily get to your social media account or web and get immediate and accurate answers about their inquiries, and the best part is, you do not require a human worker to respond.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">In 2016, Demandbase conducted an <a href="https://www.demandbase.com/press-release/marketing-executives-predict-artificial-intelligence-will-revolutionize-marketing-2020/">AI marketing study</a> and found that 80% of marketing executives believed that AI would transform marketing by 2020 despite only 10% of them currently using it, yet only 26% were confident on how to integrate AI into their business. A 2016 survey by Oracle showed that 80% of the interviewed brands were planning to integrate chatbots into their marketing by 2020.</span></p>

<h2>How AI chatbots are transforming marketing and business operations for brand</h2>

<p>AI Chatbots interact with humans using messaging service platforms such as WhatsApp, WeChat, and Facebook Messenger. Chatbots are programmed to communicate in a human-like manner, and they are helping many users, retailers, and travel agencies among other industries to improve their business operations. </p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">According to Manish Sharma, COO Rezolve AI, "3 years ago we had chatbots. Then they evolved into enterprise virtual assistants, handling more complex use cases. But even that is not enough. Now you can make decisions and switch between applications. Not science fiction anymore."</span></p>

<p>Most businesses around the globe are integrating artificial intelligence-driven tools not only as part of their strategy to reach out to customers but also to create more intelligent products. Here are more ways AI is supporting business goals.</p>

<p><strong>Leveraging chatbots for 24/7 service.</strong> A chatbot is a customer service agent working 24 hours a day. It is a simple coding process that can make clients feel like they are chatting with a real person and it can respond to these queries any time and accurately. If it cannot, the client is transferred to a human customer agent. This enables you to save time spent by staff on customers' inquiries and they will be able to focus on other tasks. </p>

<p><strong>Onsite engagement and conversions.</strong> Chatbots can escalate engagement on your platform by motivating prospects and clients to take the right action based on their inquiries. Thus, improving the overall customer satisfaction and conversion. </p>

<p><strong>Reduce operational cost while increasing value.</strong> Chatbots are capable of handling much more than humans with no errors. Also, using a chatbot will translate to fewer customer service agents since the bot handles most of the conversation only referring to those inquiries they are not programmed to solve. Also, they respond immediately and accurately. This lowers operational costs and increases the brand's value.</p>

<p><strong>Offering more intelligent services.</strong> Conventional marketing and selling of products - one-off transaction - is being replaced by the servitization model. Here organizations, deliver services or merchandise continuously. For instance, Stich Fix is a personalized styling agency that brings clothes to your doorstep based on your budget, size, and style. Also, Netflix and Dollar Shave Club use this model. AI chatbots have made all these possible. Netflix has a wide range of clients’ data, and they utilize this information to provide them with exactly what they will be interested to watch. It doesn’t matter the type of your business; chatbots can help you personalize your services and generate great customer satisfaction.</p>

<p><strong>Improving internal business processes.</strong> AI could be integrated into pretty much any aspect of your operation: human resource, marketing, supply chain, manufacturing, customer service, IT, finance, and many others. Customer service chatbots have helped brands improve their proficiency in serving their customers. The Pollack Group uses AI chatbots and big data analytics to observe successful business leaders on social media so they can fathom their confidence level in their brand. This information helps them to comprehend what ideas businesses are after, and thus they create content and offer services that these organizations need.</p>

<p><strong>Capture real-time feedback to improve customer experience and drive marketing.</strong> Jacob Cook, an expert at Tadpull explains how they use this strategy. He says that they use sentiment analysis to capture real-time feed and then route them to the most appropriate human and eventually scaling customer experience. They can then use this information to create segments in their channel to win back customers or conduct loyalty campaigns.  </p>

<p><strong>Analytics.</strong> Chatbots are capable of giving analytic reports that brands can retain for future knowledge. The analytics are derived from the informational database with data about who your chat clients are, which bots are proficient among other information that can help you improve your services. Chatbot builders such as Botup provide users with these analytics at the click of a button.</p>
