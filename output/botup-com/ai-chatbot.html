<h2>What is an AI Chatbot?</h2>

<p>The first generation bots that many companies adopted were very rigid and provided poor user experiences. Rules-based chatbots are limited to very basic scenarios. On the other hand, AI-powered chatbots provide a more human-like experience, are capable of carrying on natural conversation and continuously improve over time. In simple terms, an AI Chatbot or artificial intelligence chatbot is a software that can spur conversation with the users in the normal/ natural language through various channels such as message applications, Website, mobile apps and telephones. It can converse with humans via audio or text. AI Chatbots are the smarter versions of chatbots. They can understand machine learning and natural language processing so that it can rectify human intent better. </p>
