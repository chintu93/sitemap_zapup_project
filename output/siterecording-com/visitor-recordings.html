                <div class="inner-blog-content-sec justify-content-center">
                    <p>After developing our all-in-one Agile CRM software, we started exploring new lines of businesses for opportunity and growth. We’ve been extremely successful in catering to the needs of Fortune 500 companies, and during the course of our exploration phase, we found that we’ve the technical capabilities and business acumen to empower companies in their marketing by providing a better way to understand their website visitor behavior.</p>

<p>High bounce rate, poor conversion, and soaring drop-off rate are some of the challenges that any business wouldn’t like to stumble upon.  Marketers put different strategies and tools to stay away from these bottlenecks. But the truth is, these tools hardly depict the visitors’ real-time activity on a website and the generated insights are not that useful to overcome the challenges mentioned above.</p>

<h2><strong>The Problem</strong></h2>

<p>The use of Google Analytics is quite common for many businesses to figure out user behavior to some extent by analyzing the time spent on the website. However, these analytics tools typically return detailed numbers. And these numbers alone to comprehend the exact reason behind certain user behaviors are not enough.</p>

<p><img src="https://siterecording.com/images/blog/the-problem.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="The Problem" /></p>

<p>Therefore, we wanted a solution that goes beyond the numbers to improve the user experience for site visitors. We needed a solution with the ability to analyze the behavior of the visitor and find out the exact reason that might lead to dropping off. The solution should also have the ability to identify the areas on a web page that might be creating hindrance towards a smooth customer journey.</p>

<h2><strong>The requirement</strong></h2>

<p>Once we had clarity on the prevailing challenges, our research team started gathering the detailed requirement for the solution. And we figured out that the tool must have the following capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generates explicit and visual data points about the user’s activities on the website</li>
<li>Gives the context of the visitor’s behavior</li>
<li>Performs aforementioned tasks quickly without requiring a steep learning curve</li>
<li>Records all engagement including mouse movement, clicks, and more</li>
<li>Store and compile data along with the actual video</li>
<li>Help make data-driven decisions and better optimize the website</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>

<p>We noticed that there’s no such potential tool available in the market that could accomplish our requirements. And then, we decided to build the tool on our own. We came up with Siterecording – our one-stop solution to counter all the challenges mentioned above, and bolster any marketing team to deal with issues in the likes of bounce rate, conversion, drop-off, etc. </p>

<p>We noted that the solutions available in the market are not loaded with the necessary capabilities to empower marketers to deal with prevailing challenges.</p>

<p>Whenever a user visits a website, Siterecording starts recording all engagement, such as mouse movement, clicks, and more, and then compiles and stores these data along with the actual video. Marketers can leverage insights to make data-driven decisions and better optimize the website.</p>
