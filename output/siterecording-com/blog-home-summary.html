                Every website owner, be it a business entity or individual, needs to know the people who are visiting their site and what they do whilst there. With such data, marketers and salespeople are best placed to understand their audience. Armed with this information, they are likely to develop the right content as well as employ the appropriate strategies in order to pull in more people to their website rather that push them away. Thatâ€™s why every business worth its salt must have a website session recording tool.

                These days, advertisers can quantify nearly everything, giving us a remarkable capacity and access to various ways of measuring and improving the performance of your marketing efforts. Yet, at times, we can get excessively fixated on the measurements that look great on paper however don&#x27;t give as much knowledge we think, similar to page clicks and page views. A high portion of website traffic can demonstrate the quality of your headline or product description, yet it doesn&#x27;t disclose to you the entire story of what way your website visitors take while browsing your website, or how precisely they engage with the page.
