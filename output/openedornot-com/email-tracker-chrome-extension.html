<p>According to Dela Quist "Signing up is a powerful signal of intent to buy. Send them email until they do."</p>

<p>When it comes to email tracking software, there are a large number of them available for deployment, but not all of them are all that useful. Most of them let you know whether an email was opened or not, but not much besides. That clearly is not of great help at all.</p>

<p>The tools that you choose should not just help you keep a track of the email opens, but also let you know how many times an email was opened and also if it was tracked. They should not only offer line tracking, but go beyond and provide cutting edge email engagement data.

Of course, if you are looking to get the full suite of features, you have got to be paying for them.</p>

<p>The great thing about email tracking is the fact that it saves marketers loads of time by automating the process of email outreach. It helps one stop chasing after prospects who are simply not interested in one’s products or services. The fact that one is empowered to interact with only those who are genuinely interested in one’s product or service is the greatest benefit that accrues to one thanks to using email tracking.</p>

<p>That makes email way better than any other form of digital outreach in that you are that much more focused in your outreach, which makes you obtain way more ROI on your investment. Our ways of communicating with people may have undergone a tremendous change, but emailing has stayed with us and is likely to, going forward.</p>

<p>That being stated, the method of sending emails is changing and technology these days allows us to find out what exactly has happened to the emails that we sent out.Tracking your emails can help you determine the success or otherwise of your email campaigns.</p>

<p>That apart, emails are also a means of sending across things like invoices, invites, contracts and so on. It definitely makes sense to track these emails as well. As a matter of fact every marketer, sales professional, recruiter, customer support executive and others like them would benefit from the information that email tracking provides. It would help them take better decisions using the insights provided by their target audience.</p>

<p>The email tracker chrome extensions described above are just what any business across scale and industry or individual needs to enhance their emailing capability. One can choose the one that best suits one’s purpose or budget. The idea behind using these user friendly and super efficient mail trackers is not to pester anybody or stalk them, but to efficiently approach only those prospects that actually are pre inclined to buy one’s products and services or at least are considering it. Using email tracking will in fact empower one to give a wide berth to those who are not interested in one’s offerings. To that extent it makes email marketing that much more palatable to people.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the analytics that the above tools provide help one to creatively engage with the right kind of people who would actually benefit from their communication. The fact that enail tracing can now deploy AI makes one almost always take the right call when sending out emails. One can now use audio, video and graphics apart from written content to connect with one’s focused target audience in a manner that is likely to appeal to them at a very personal level.</p>

<p>We are in the middle of an extraordinary digital revolution which is changing the very way that we all live our lives. Email marketing these days is not the mass mail and forget kind of outreach anymore. It is much more researched and nuanced. Bespoke communication lies at the heart of the new age kind of emailing. </p>

<p>This is something that all businesses, marketing managers, entrepreneurs and solopreneurs would do well to get a handle on. That being stated, the best way to leverage email outreach is by doing it the right way.and there can’t be a better way than leveraging the power of any of the tools described above. Email tracking is not a sinister ruse to keep a tab on others, but a way to make mailing unobtrusive and useful for the recipients. It is something that doesn’t require an astronomical advertising budget and the ROI that you obtain from emailing is something else. 
It is not surprising that emailing has become an integral part of any business’s marketing funnel. The advent of email tracking tools are largely responsible for this resurgence.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>According to Dela Quist "Signing up is a powerful signal of intent to buy. Send them email until they do."</p>

<p>When it comes to email tracking software, there are a large number of them available for deployment, but not all of them are all that useful. Most of them let you know whether an email was opened or not, but not much besides. That clearly is not of great help at all.</p>

<p>The tools that you choose should not just help you keep a track of the email opens, but also let you know how many times an email was opened and also if it was tracked. They should not only offer line tracking, but go beyond and provide cutting edge email engagement data. The Google Chrome extensions you log into should work with the email that you are using in a manner that it revolutionizes the email marketing effort. It should really turn your emailing effort into a growth engine.</p>

<p>That apart, the tool in question should be easy to use, providing you with a dashboard view to obtain information about all the tracked emails at a glance. Besides, it should also be viewable on a mobile phone. An email tracker which facilitates CRM will obviously be favored by enterprise level businesses. What also matters is the price. If you are a beginner who plans to learn the ropes, then you could look at free offerings that many email tracking tool providers offer. Of course, if you are looking to get the full suite of features, you have got to be paying for them.</p>

<p>The great thing about email tracking is the fact that it saves marketers loads of time by automating the process of email outreach. It helps one stop chasing after prospects who are simply not interested in one’s products or services. The fact that one is empowered to interact with only those who are genuinely interested in one’s product or service is the greatest benefit that accrues to one thanks to using email tracking.</p>

<p>That makes email way better than any other form of digital outreach in that you are that much more focused in your outreach, which makes you obtain way more ROI on your investment. Our ways of communicating with people may have undergone a tremendous change, but emailing has stayed with us and is likely to, going forward.</p>

<p>That being stated, the method of sending emails is changing and technology these days allows us to find out what exactly has happened to the emails that we sent out.Tracking your emails can help you determine the success or otherwise of your email campaigns.</p>

<p>That apart, emails are also a means of sending across things like invoices, invites, contracts and so on. It definitely makes sense to track these emails as well. As a matter of fact every marketer, sales professional, recruiter, customer support executive and others like them would benefit from the information that email tracking provides. It would help them take better decisions using the insights provided by their target audience.</p>

<p>The email tracker chrome extensions described above are just what any business across scale and industry or individual needs to enhance their emailing capability. One can choose the one that best suits one’s purpose or budget. The idea behind using these user friendly and super efficient mail trackers is not to pester anybody or stalk them, but to efficiently approach only those prospects that actually are pre inclined to buy one’s products and services or at least are considering it. Using email tracking will in fact empower one to give a wide berth to those who are not interested in one’s offerings. To that extent it makes email marketing that much more palatable to people.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the analytics that the above tools provide help one to creatively engage with the right kind of people who would actually benefit from their communication. The fact that enail tracing can now deploy AI makes one almost always take the right call when sending out emails. One can now use audio, video and graphics apart from written content to connect with one’s focused target audience in a manner that is likely to appeal to them at a very personal level.</p>

<p>We are in the middle of an extraordinary digital revolution which is changing the very way that we all live our lives. Email marketing these days is not the mass mail and forget kind of outreach anymore. It is much more researched and nuanced. Bespoke communication lies at the heart of the new age kind of emailing. </p>

<p>This is something that all businesses, marketing managers, entrepreneurs and solopreneurs would do well to get a handle on. That being stated, the best way to leverage email outreach is by doing it the right way.and there can’t be a better way than leveraging the power of any of the tools described above. Email tracking is not a sinister ruse to keep a tab on others, but a way to make mailing unobtrusive and useful for the recipients. It is something that doesn’t require an astronomical advertising budget and the ROI that you obtain from emailing is something else. 
It is not surprising that emailing has become an integral part of any business’s marketing funnel. The advent of email tracking tools are largely responsible for this resurgence.</p>
