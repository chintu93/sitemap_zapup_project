                                            I chose 500apps because of their value and incredible superior customer service. They really care about small-to-medium sized organizations like ours, whether you&#x27;re very CRM experienced or lightly so. Every business needs a CRM these days. Compared to HubSpot or Fusion Marketing, they really present a better value and are quite robust yet simple to use. Very pleased!</p>

                                             500apps is a pretty compressive system for a good price. Plenty of integrations. Sales, marketing and help desk automation. I love that it integrates with IMAP and the chrome widget is brilliant for pulling in LinkedIn data. I&#x27;ve found the customer service incredibly responsive. These guys really care about their reputation.</p>

                                            I love 500apps. It&#x27;s a perfect solution for startups. The price is right and the system does all I need it to. I had a small issue and called the customer service line. I was really impressed being able to speak with the team all the way from Australia. They resolved my issue immediately and were very nice to deal with. I highly recommend this solution. 500apps is excellent for startups who can&#x27;t afford the high prices of alternative solutions out there.</p>

                                          I have worked with quite a few CRM solutions including SugarCRM, Daylite, and Salesforce. Within a few days I could build scripts to import our data into 500apps using their Rest APIs. If you are building a web app, and want to store customer data into a CRM, Agile makes it easy. The concepts of using web triggers in Agile CRM to trigger based on events that occur on our website or our web app is a game changer for our customer support and marketing teams. I am typically very skeptical to change CRM solutions, as most of the work falls on me to actually move the data. With Agile, I feel like we are more in control of the data, and we have given our sales, marketing and staff additional tools to make communication with clients easier.</p>

                                        Very pleased with the Support received and the tool during initial kicking of the tires. The knowledge base gets points for simplicity, however, needs better context and examples provided to help users such as myself. Looking forward to growing with this CRM!</p>

I highly recommend 500apps.</p>
