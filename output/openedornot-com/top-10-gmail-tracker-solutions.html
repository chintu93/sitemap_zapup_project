<p><img src="https://openedornot.com/images/blog/gm-identify-the-best-time-to-send-emails.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Identify the Best Time to Send Emails" /></p>

<p>With 269 billion emails sent and received each day, it's more critical than ever to ensure that your messages are reaching your target audience. While email tracking doesn’t guarantee that your recipients will take action on your message, it does offer you a foolproof way to find out how many of them have opened and read your email. </p>

<p>You can use this insight to improve your outreach by, for example, removing unresponsive contacts from your list. An essential tool in any email marketer's arsenal, email trackers help you keep track of how your email campaigns are doing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you can see selecting the right tracker is quite important. British businessman, <a href="https://www.wisesayings.com/email-quotes/#ixzz6gs73IQgH ">John Caldwell</a> said, "To get the right message to the right person at the right time you first need to get the right data to the right database at the right time." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By signing up for and installing an email tracker, you'll be able to access information that lets you know when your emails were opened, whether the recipient clicked any link inside the body of the email, and more. </p>

<p>With 269 billion emails sent and received each day, it's more critical than ever to ensure that your messages are reaching your target audience. While email tracking doesn’t guarantee that your recipients will take action on your message, it does offer you a foolproof way to find out how many of them have opened and read your email. </p>

<p>You can use this insight to improve your outreach by, for example, removing unresponsive contacts from your list. An essential tool in any email marketer's arsenal, email trackers help you keep track of how your email campaigns are doing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you can see selecting the right tracker is quite important. British businessman, <a href="https://www.wisesayings.com/email-quotes/#ixzz6gs73IQgH ">John Caldwell</a> said, "To get the right message to the right person at the right time you first need to get the right data to the right database at the right time." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By signing up for and installing an email tracker, you'll be able to access information that lets you know when your emails were opened, whether the recipient clicked any link inside the body of the email, and more. </p>
