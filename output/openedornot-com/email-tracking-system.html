<p><img src="https://openedornot.com/images/blog/what-is-email-tracking.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Benefits of Using Robust Email Tracking System" /></p>

<p>With the advent of new technologies almost every other year in today's age of information, most of what was termed as 'vital' a couple of decades back have now either become redundant or automated. Emails may have been around for a long time now but unlike a few other processes/mediums, they still remain very much relevant. While it is still a major mode of communication, the need is significantly greater now to use it cleverly &amp; create personalized content if you want to elicit a response. </p>

<p>We are surrounded with useful data that we either didn't know existed or were simply unable to obtain. Information that could greatly benefit our businesses and accelerate overall sales. Founder of HARO, <a href="https://twitter.com/petershankman/status/1339196901158215680?s=20">Peter Shankman</a> believes that majority of people in the world are still doing email marketing incredibly poorly.</p>

<p>To aid with this, companies of all sizes are turning to a wide variety of sales acceleration software for data collection and analysis. This is where a solid email tracking system comes in handy. However, it is one of the most helpful, and often times overlooked applications. An email tracking system is a truly invaluable resource that can be used in business to get a better understanding of how your emails are being used and received.</p>

<h3><strong>What is email tracking</strong></h3>

<p>Email tracking is the process of tracking sent emails and using that data to inform business decisions. Most email tracking tools capture data on open rates, times, and locations, as well as click-throughs on links and attachments.</p>

<h3><strong>How Does An Email Tracking System Work?</strong></h3>

<p>One of the best things about an email tracking system is that it can be used with existing email operations. It utilizes a fascinating process in which information is distributed and collected through in place systems with the addition of various bits of computer code. </p>

<p><img src="https://openedornot.com/images/blog/how-does-an-email-tracking-system-work.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="How Does An Email Tracking System Work" /></p>

<p>An email tracking system typically uses an image pixel embedded within the email. When your lead opens the email, this pixel is invoked immediately, giving you alerts about when it was opened, from which device it was viewed, how many times your prospect opened your email, etc. Also, you can track metrics like delivery, click &amp; bounce rates instantaneously. What this means is that you now have real-time insights about what happened to your email. Which in turn guides you about the next best steps. By eliminating the ‘cold follow up approach, it helps in creating a standout multi-step process to get that coveted response.</p>

<h3><strong>Benefits of using a Robust Email Tracking System</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://openedornot.com/images/blog/robust-email-tracking-system.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Robust email tracking system" /></p>

<p>Many organizations still don't track their email campaigns still. They think that sending an email is all they need to do. But that’s not right. Let's highlight some of the benefits of using an email tracking system.</p>

<h4><strong>1. An Email Tracking System Allows You to Stay on Track with Your Emails</strong></h4>

<p>With an email tracking system, you wait until you see a notification that informs you a prospective customer has opened and read your message. This helps you stay front of mind, which can help increase sales and referrals. </p>

<h4><strong>2. An Email Tracking System Provides Unique Insight</strong></h4>

<p>Let’s face it, writing emails can be daunting and frustrating. It's easy to struggle with how to begin or what to say to fill in that white space. With an email tracking system, you have data around your emails, and when you can see a clear connection between specific emails getting replies or not get getting replies, you can make changes that will have an impact.</p>

<h4><strong>3. You Can Also Send More Impactful Follow-Ups</strong></h4>

<p>One of the benefits of using an email tracking system is that it allows you to send the right follow-up to your prospect so that you increase the chance of a conversion. Without knowing if a reader opened your email, clicked on any links, or sent it directly to Trash, it's harder for marketers and salespeople to create an engaging follow-up message that fuels online chat. </p>

<p><img src="https://openedornot.com/images/blog/impactful-follow-ups.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Impactful follow ups" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, using an email tracking system clarifies how interested each recipient was in an email. With the help of these tools, you can create different follow-up sequences. </p>

<p>Using an email tracking system helps marketing and sales managers find the right timing for a follow-up. If you answer prospects as soon as they read your email, the negotiation process will move down the sales funnel much faster. </p>

<h4><strong>4. You Can Also Schedule Emails so That They Are Sent at the Right Time</strong></h4>

<p>An email tracking system also lets you schedule emails to be sent at a specific time. Through trial and failure, marketers realized that sending time is a crucial part of a campaign's success. Depending on the type of emails you are sending, some time slots fit better than others.</p>

<p><img src="https://openedornot.com/images/blog/schedule-emails-sent-right-time.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Schedule emails sent right time" /></p>

<p>Using an email tracking system allows marketers to test this data and find the sending time that works better for their audience. Also, tracking tools allow scheduling response messages depending on when a reader opens a letter, giving teams full control of email marketing timing.</p>

<h4><strong>5. Stimulates a conversation</strong></h4>

<p>This has to be the ultimate goal while sending an email. Now, adopting an email tracking system isn't a guarantee for a conversation (nothing can be!). But it will equip you to try &amp; engage in an intelligent fashion.</p>

<p>For example, if you see that a prospect has opened your email &amp; clicked on the links which you attached, that would be your cue to make a relevant follow-up. Because you’re still on the top of his/her mind. Even with the follow-ups, the fact that you get to know the amount of engagement on them will help you modify the content accordingly.</p>

<h4><strong>6. Provides context</strong></h4>

<p>Implementing an email tracking system will give you a detailed activity history with every prospect. This can give you a sneak peek into the lead's mentality. Email tracking provides you with valuable insight into your email interactions with contacts, networks, customers, or prospects. You can use this insight to strengthen your outreach by catering to their specific relationship with you.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you see that a contact has opened your email multiple times in one day, you can follow up while you're top-of-mind. </li>
<li>If you included links or attachments in an email prior to a meeting, you can see if your contact has viewed them. </li>
<li>If you sent a follow up email, you can determine if the recipient is reviewing what you sent.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will go a long way in finding that one point which will pique his/her interest. Understanding &amp; using these will help you create better emails, those which are more likely to get you the desired outcome.</p>

<h4><strong>7. Helps create automated workflows</strong></h4>

<p>If you're planning to set up a comprehensive marketing/sales process, tracking emails can prove to be a solid base on which you can build. An advanced email tracking system allows you to build automations based on triggers (like an email opened or a link clicked).</p>

<p><img src="https://openedornot.com/images/blog/helps-create-automated-workflows.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Helps create automated workflows" /></p>

<p>This provides you with the creative power of defining a lead journey. For example – you can choose to send a predefined yet personalized follow up content as soon as a link is clicked. Or, wait for a specific amount of time after an email is opened before sending out the next one. In all such cases, the dream starts with a simple step - tracking emails.</p>

<p>The details provided by an email tracking system can make a massive difference. Among other things, this, in turn, creates a huge difference in the way your marketing &amp; sales teams think. The way they operate also takes a turn because they are armed with data. No more sending blind emails and hoping for the best.</p>

<h4><strong>8. An Email tracking system saves time.</strong></h4>

<p>An email tracking system enables you to see whether your first email was interesting enough to your recipient to open. By preventing unnecessary follow-up emails, email tracking saves time both for the sales rep and the email recipient. </p>

<p><img src="https://openedornot.com/images/blog/an-email-tracking-system-savestime.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Email tracking system saves time" /></p>

<p>No one wants to get multiple follow-up emails when they haven't even opened the first one. If they haven't opened the first, they're unlikely to open future follow-up emails, so you can and should stop there.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you notice a contact is clicking on the links you sent and viewing a cover letter or a proposal that you attached, you know that you're currently at the top of their minds. Reaching out to them at that point, when they're thinking about your proposal, makes that conversation much more relevant and timely. </p>

<h4><strong>9. Marketing and Sales</strong></h4>

<p>The information obtained through an email tracking system can be extremely useful for marketing and sales purposes. Email trackers also reveal how much time a recipient spends reading a particular email. You can use this insight to improve the relevancy of your content. Research reveals that relevant emails generate <a href="https://www.business2community.com/email-marketing/email-marketing-trends-and-strategies-for-2019-02165509">18 times more revenue</a> than broadcast emails.</p>

<p><img src="https://openedornot.com/images/blog/marketing-and-sales.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Marketing and sales" /></p>

<p>Let’s say your prospective customers are not spending a lot of time on emails that contain text-based product information but are more interested in emails that showcase your items through videos and attractive images.</p>

<p>Knowing their preferences, you can create an automated campaign with the content that potential customers are expecting and send follow-up emails to bring home the sale.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>As with most things, people and businesses tend to get comfortable with what works. This creates a stable business system but it also creates stagnation and limits growth. New technology is being developed every day that can change the way business is done and sales are made. The traditional form of emailing has its benefits but the system as a whole is being underutilized. A new email tracking system takes full advantage of the current data that’s available within email delivery. Emailing processes have drastically changed over the last 20 years. Companies are now leveraging email tracking systems to empower salespeople with critical insight so they can send email messages to potential buyers at the right time to get more responses and win more business. </p>
