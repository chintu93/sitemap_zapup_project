                    <h1>What is Email Tracking?</h1>

<h1> </h1>

<p>To the question what is email tracking the short and straight answer is email tracking enables a business or an individual to determine as to whether one’s email to people has been opened, the links clicked and the attachments viewed. What it essentially achieves is to give one the wherewithal to forge interactive relationships with one’s prospects in a highly competitive inbox scenario. According to David Newman, "Email has an ability many channels don’t: creating valuable, personal touches – at scale."</p>

<p>Essentially a method to track the delivery of email messages to the target audience in question, it involves the deployment of a digitally time stamped mechanism that is able to pinpoint the exact day and time of the receipt or opening of the email. It is also able to identify the IP address of the recipient. </p>

<p>**How does it function?</p>

<p>Email tracking makes use of tracking software that allows one to know exactly when somebody accesses our emails, clicks the links on view attachments. The software places a discreet image pixel in the email that allows one to determine the precise time and date an email has been opened by the recipient. That makes this technology very useful in determining whether the recipient of the email in question received it or clicked on the accompanying link. The information that can be gleaned from email tracking encompasses the IP address, the device and browser used by the recipient, as well as a date and time stamp pertaining to when the email was accessed.</p>

<p>**Why perform email tracking?</p>

<p>Now that we are clear about the answer to the question, what is email tracking, let's understand why we need to do it. There are several advantages that accrue from email tracking(https://www.hubspot.com/sales/email-tracking-guide). Let's look at what these might be-</p>

<p><em>*</em>1. Helps Save Time- </p>

<p>It makes no sense for a marketer to send mail after mail to someone who doesn’t care to open it. By identifying such people email tracking makes it apparent to an email marketer that it is time to move on to more responsive prospects. This not only saves time and makes the emailing more efficient it also ensures that the brand prestige is maintained. This is on account of the fact that sending emails repeatedly to non responsive prospects is tantamount to spamming them.  That is another answer to the question what is email tracking.</p>

<p><em>*</em>2. Makes the Emailing Relevant-</p>

<p>By calibrating your emailing strategy based on the prospect data provided by email tracking you can ensure the relevance of your emailing. If, for instance, a prospect has opened your email a number of times, you can surmise that he or she has an interest in your offering. You can capitalize on that by sending a follow up mail. What’s great is that you can also determine if your follow up mail has been reviewed as well.</p>

<p><em>*</em>3. Refine the Email List- </p>

<p>By enabling you to know as to who opens your email and who doesn’t email tracking allows you to prune your list of the people who are obviously not interested in your product or service. This will help you refine your list and make it more effective. It will also give you a better sense of what is email tracking.</p>

<p>**Email Tracking to Improve Business Prospects</p>

<p>Email tracking makes it possible to enhance business prospects in ways which may not be very apparent at first. You may not think much of somebody opening your mail, but the fact that they did so may be indicative of a huge interest in their part. So, if you sent a follow up email and landed a $100,000 contract, you sure would be thankful that you had an email tracking software installed. </p>

<p>**The Ways to Track an Email</p>

<p>The answer to the question, what is email tracking should be quite evident by now. One can easily track emails by using email tracking software like OpenedorNot (https://openedornot.com). It would however make sense to follow a few ground rules. Let’s look at what these might be-</p>

<p><em>*</em>Follow Standard Email Tracking Practices- </p>

<p>You would do well to put in place proper guidelines in your organization’s privacy policy so that people who subscribe to your email are aware that tracking notifications have been activated. Of course, you have got to ensure that these standards are put into practice prior to the starting of email tracking. One should also ensure that these are adhered to.</p>

<p><em>*</em>Installation of Email Tracking App-</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier a good email tracking app will let you know when someone has opened or clicked the email sent by you. There will also be real time information of the exact time the email was opened and how many times it was opened. As you might imagine, this will give you a very good idea of how well your email marketing campaign is going.</p>

<p><em>*</em>Use the Contact Profile Feature-</p>

<p>Many email tracking tools provide the contact profile feature which let you know who exactly you are mailing too and in what context. This not only lets you know the name of the company the intended recipient works for, but also what stage of communications you would be with the person and the relevant timeline. All this information naturally puts an email marketer in a very advantageous position indeed.</p>

<p>**Email Tracking and Growth</p>

<p>An email tracking tool is actually an email intelligence too that lets a business achieve tremendous growth by optimally leveraging the power of content. This tweet is demonstrative of that fact email tracking is critically important to people-"New email tracking software and tools are constantly being improved. But one thing that remains critical to the success of any #emailmarketing tool is the email tracking pixel."(https://twitter.com/paulthewlis/status/1333747176749600768)
You may have the biggest of email marketing campaigns, but unless you have a handle on what’s happening to your emails, it won’t amount to much. You need to know if the emails are getting any responses or whether the links in the emails are being clicked or not. If you don’t have the slightest idea about what’s the response to your emails, you are hardly going to be able to make a success of it.</p>

<p>You cannot achieve business growth through email marketing without effective tracking. This is particularly true, when your outreach is large and extensive. Without email tracking in place you would be left wondering if you have already emailed a particular intended recipient. Perhaps you want to know when you last contacted them. You would wonder if some intended recipients have already replied or if they needed to be followed up on. You would also not be sure if your team members have already contacted the prospects you are mailing. You possibly might have to go over your sent mails or the Excel sheet carrying the prospect details and try to figure out what’s going on.</p>

<p>All of those problems can be dealt with quite easily by using an email tracking software. Gone are the days when you just composed an email and sent it across and waited for something to happen. You would have no idea if the intended recipient got the mail or not, whether they opened it or not and whether they cared to go through the attachment you so want them to read.</p>

<p>You don’t imagine that the trans-national giants like WalMart, Amazon and Apple don’t have a clue about what happens to their marketing emails? Of course, not. They know exactly how you respond to their email. They know whether you opened it or not, the headline that they likely clicked, the product images that caught you fancy and so on.</p>

<p>The same kind of detailed tracking is available to you as well. You can get quite a lot of data pertaining to your prospects including the following:</p>

<p>-The date and time of  opening the email.
-The prospect’s  IP Address
-The browser used by the prospect.
-The operating system along with its version used by the prospect.
-The kind of device used by the prospect.
-The screen resolution of the prospect’s device.
-The relevant cookies.</p>

<p>So basically, email tracking puts you on top of the email marketing process enabling it to micro manage it in great detail.  You can use email tracking software within your existing email system. You may be comfortable with your email marketing system, but that doesn't mean that you won’t benefit immensely from an upgrade. What’s great about technology is the fact that it's forever evolving and new email tracking software is a fine example of that. It lets you fully leverage the existing data that you have. You can use it to empower your sales team with the right kind of critical insights to send email messages to the prospective buyers at the best possible time to obtain maximum responses.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, email marketing is so much simpler than having to post daily on social media or work very hard on devising the right kind of blog campaign to attract traffic that might eventually convert. Things are much simpler with email. You talk directly with someone you know is a possible prospect and what email tracking helps you with is in knowing how interested they are, so that you can calibrate your message accordingly. </p>

<p>What’s more it is a way cheaper method to obtain customers. Every email of a well planned email campaign is a potential deal maker. But, only if you know how to conduct the campaign well, which can in fact be easily done with the help of an email tracking software. There is so much which the “humble” email can do, which other forms of communication cannot. They help you obtain feedback, carry out focused personalized messaging, promote your product or service and above all enable a highly one-to -one form of communication, albeit with a large number of people.</p>

<p>Another big advantage of using emails for outreach is the fact that email is an asynchronous medium not requiring the sender and receiver to be simultaneously online, which makes it very advantageous to leverage at one’s own convenience. The fact that businesses exist in an ultra competitive space means that one needs to put one’s best foot forward, when it comes to communicating with one’s customers in the right way and the right time.</p>

<p>The quicker and more efficiently that one can do it, the more successful one will be in one’s sales and marketing efforts. Email marketing done the right way with the help of email tracking software is just the way to do that. Fortunately, there are a number of email marketing software available in the market that can be installed in conjunction with any email service. Once a software is downloaded it is very easy to customize one’s email campaign in a manner that delivers the best possible results. </p>

<p>Email has been around for quite some  time now and there was a time when people thought that its days were numbered, especially since the advent of social media, but it has managed to hold its own. This is to a very large extent on account of the fact that email marketing has become extremely focused on account of the edge that email tracking tools provide it.
The fact that email tracking has evolved along the way makes it an even more potent marketing methodology. It doesn't matter what sort of a business one owns, or an organisation that one represents-email marketing will work just as fine for everyone, if done the right way. </p>

<p>It's not for nothing that organizations ranging from Fortune 500 companies to mom and pop stores are leveraging the power of email marketing to their own benefit.For all the talk of SEO and social media marketing, it is the good old email that provides the maximum bang for the buck. Any business that overlooks that does so to their own detriment. Of course, it is important to remember that an effective email campaign is incomplete without the help it derives from a new age email tracking software. One only has to look at the spectacular successes some of the best known brands in the business have had on account of their email marketing campaign to appreciate the impact of email tracking tools. If you haven’t installed an email tracking software yet, it’s time to do so now. Hopefully, we are more than clear about the question, what is email tracking now. </p>
