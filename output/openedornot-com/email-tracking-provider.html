<p>Email tracking is a must-have practice for marketing managers especially in relation to improving customer experience. Marketing blogger, <a href="https://www.mailerlite.com/blog/email-marketing-quotes">Joe Chernov</a> said, "Good Marketing makes the company look smart. Great Marketing makes the customer feel smart." It provides teams with insights on how their campaigns perform and introduce business owners to new ways of optimizing workflows. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/ValaAfshar/status/631987428136472576?s=20">Gartner</a>, tech companies are using mobile, social and CRM technologies to grow and scale sales and marketing. Email tracking is one of these technologies.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that a single email tracking provider rarely covers all needs of marketing and sales teams. That's why business owners should research several platforms and create a toolset that helps gather as many relevant insights as possible. Since most of the tools featured above come with free trial versions, maintaining a tracking toolset typically isn't expensive.</p>

<p>The right email tracking provider isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. Sometimes, all you need is a quick add-on to tell you whether or not individual recipients open your emails. Other times, you need a full-featured email marketing software, with an eye toward robust reporting.</p>

<p>No matter what your needs look like today, any of the tools above are available on Chrome Web Store. These providers will help you better measure and improve your email game and in the end, that's what it's all about, right?

<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>

<p>Email tracking is a must-have practice for marketing managers especially in relation to improving customer experience. Marketing blogger, <a href="https://www.mailerlite.com/blog/email-marketing-quotes">Joe Chernov</a> said, "Good Marketing makes the company look smart. Great Marketing makes the customer feel smart." It provides teams with insights on how their campaigns perform and introduce business owners to new ways of optimizing workflows. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/ValaAfshar/status/631987428136472576?s=20">Gartner</a>, tech companies are using mobile, social and CRM technologies to grow and scale sales and marketing. Email tracking is one of these technologies.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that a single email tracking provider rarely covers all needs of marketing and sales teams. That's why business owners should research several platforms and create a toolset that helps gather as many relevant insights as possible. Since most of the tools featured above come with free trial versions, maintaining a tracking toolset typically isn't expensive.</p>

<p>The right email tracking provider isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. Sometimes, all you need is a quick add-on to tell you whether or not individual recipients open your emails. Other times, you need a full-featured email marketing software, with an eye toward robust reporting.</p>

<p>No matter what your needs look like today, any of the tools above are available on Chrome Web Store. These providers will help you better measure and improve your email game and in the end, that's what it's all about, right? And there's no better place to start than <a href="https://openedornot.com/">OpenedOrNot</a>.
