They also help with the click-throughs on links as well as attachments. Armed with this kind of precise data any business will be able to hone and fine tune their email marketing in a manner that gets them optimal leads and customers. The benefits of email tracking don't really end and are quite a few.</p>

<p>That emailing is tremendously important to businesses is universally accepted, as evidenced by this quote from Rebecca Riserbato, “99% of consumers check their email every day and it is by far the preferred way to receive updates from brands ( -https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats).

This lets you get very good at determining  the best time to contact a prospect. The success or failure of any business are hinged upon their ability to make the right move at the right time. By providing context and insight about the email recipients, email tracking software enables just that. To a large extent it determines a business’s success or failure.
