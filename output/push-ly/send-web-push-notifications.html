                       <p>Do you use web push notifications in your digital marketing strategy? If not, start now before it’s too late!</p>

<p>In the era of smartphones and mobile apps, why are we talking about web push notifications?</p>

<p>Well, desktop usage still accounts for 42% of total time spent on the internet, and the recent PushPushGo data reveals that 85% of online stores and a wide range of other e-commerce operations used web push notifications in their business.</p>

<p>Web Push Notification is a relatively new customer engagement channel but growing fast and steadily in recent times. In this article, we’ll share 9 amazing web push notification tips to maximize the impact of your marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>Let’s start…</p>

<h3><strong>Tip 1: Right Opt-In Prompt</strong></h3>

<p>Set the right opt-in prompt for web push notification. Make use of a native prompt, which is a single-step process, or a custom prompt – a double-step process? Both have pros and cons. Native prompt, for instance, has less friction and may lead to more opt-ins but in many cases, users block it. In addition, with the native prompt, you can’t promote any custom message and this leads to a high number of unsubscriptions in the later stage. On the contrary, the custom prompt works better due to its flexible nature.</p>

<h3><strong>Tip 2: Behavior-based Targeting</strong></h3>

<p>Increase the relevance and impact of your push marketing campaigns with automated behavior-based targeting. Once a user performs an action that you specified as an event, the opt-in would appear.
You can set multiple parameters based on the user’s behavior and according to your business. For instance, e-commerce sites may consider product views, blogs or news websites can consider the time spent on a particular blog or article, etc.
Behavior-based web push notifications have higher engagement rates and increase customer retention.</p>
