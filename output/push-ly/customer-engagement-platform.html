                    <p>In today’s competitive marketplace, customer engagement plays a critical role in ensuring growth. If you operate an online business, the importance of a solid customer engagement platform is even greater, as it directly impacts your variables such as website ranking, traffic, customer reviews, and most importantly, the bottom line.</p>

<p>Push notifications are relatively new to the marketing scene, and they’ve developed somewhat of a bad reputation for being just another annoying way for brands to intrude.</p>

<p>However, when used correctly, push notifications facilitate growth by enhancing a brand’s existing customer engagement platform. Push notifications can boost key performance indicators (KPIs) like customer renewals, repeat purchases, and customer retention. They present a tremendous potential to engage and re-engage your customers.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white"><em>”Push notifications represent a great way to communicate with your audience,”</em> <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/push-notifications-to-boost-engagement/">says marketing guru Neil Patel.</a>*”</span></p>

<p>According to a study by Localytics, 52% of smartphone users have push enabled on their devices, and these notifications can be used to benefit businesses in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Directing users to your social media channels</li>
<li>Promoting products and services (especially special offers)</li>
<li>Building trust and brand reputation by delivering valuable content</li>
<li>Engaging users who aren’t currently on your site</li>
<li>Restoring abandoned carts for ecommerce applications”*</li>
</ul>

<p>Push notification campaigns provide insightful data into the minds of your consumers.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll talk about push notifications and how well this customer engagement platform can perform under pressure.</p>

<h3>What Are Push Notifications?</h3>

<p>Push notifications are brief, clickable message updates that an app or a website delivers to its users or subscribers even if the respective app or website is not active on the user’s device.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the browser push notifications are not similar to in-app notifications. In-app notifications pop up only when it is triggered by an existing application on a particular mobile device. On the contrary, a subscriber can receive browser push notifications through browsers on any device.</p>

<p>Regardless of types of notifications, the push notification is a powerful customer engagement platform that enables instant, automated, and direct communication between a brand and its audience.</p>

<h3>Transform Your Customer Engagement Platform with Push Notifications</h3>

<p>Push notifications are a relatively new digital marketing channel compared to others such as social media, newsletters, and SMS marketing. These nifty little messages, however, have proven to be extremely useful for obtaining customer renewals and repeat purchases.</p>

<p>If you’re not making full use of push notifications, it’s high time to transform your customer engagement platform.</p>

<p>Why the urgency?</p>

<p>Many of your competitors are likely overlooking the importance of push notifications. With proper planning, push notification campaigns can give you a clear advantage over competing brands who’ve not yet embraced them.</p>

<p><strong>Push notifications enhance the customer engagement platform with benefits that include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ease of opt-in and opt-out for notifications</li>
<li>No need to share any personal information to subscribe</li>
<li>Instant communications &amp; delivery</li>
<li>Data collection &amp; analysis</li>

<p><strong>Some key elements of a successful push notification strategy include:</strong></p>

<h3>1. Compelling content</h3>

<p>Make your content crisp, concise, and to the point, and develop it with your target audience in mind. Remember, compelling content is not necessarily advertising copy. Create persuasive copy for the push notifications, and include catchy one-liners and CTAs. Make sure the message you’re conveying is tailored to individual needs and preferences for better user experience.</p>

<h3>2. Make Use of Existing Subscriber Base</h3>

<p>Do you already have a good number of email subscribers? If so, consider leveraging your contacts list to jumpstart your push notification campaigns. Embed a link within your newsletter that leads to a page that triggers a push notification permission prompt.</p>

<h3>3. Send the Right Kind of Notifications</h3>

<p>A successful push notification strategy is one that sends engaging and eye-catching content to users who want or need it most at that time. To find out the most effective type of push notifications for your users, consumer research and A/B testing can provide invaluable insight. Above all else, don’t be afraid to take chances and think outside the box when creating content for your consumers or clients.</p>

<h3>4. Segment and Customize</h3>

<p>Personalization is paramount. Instead of sending out the same message to all of your subscribers, make push notifications personal, contextual, and timely. To do this, you must first segment your customers based on consumer data and shared traits. Then, send specific notifications to the right segment to boost engagement.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to take chances and think outside the box when creating content for your consumers or clients.</p>
