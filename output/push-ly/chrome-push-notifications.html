                    <p>Connect with your audience no matter where they are with push notifications.</p>

<p>When it comes to customer engagement, push notifications have emerged as one of the most powerful tools in a marketer's arsenal. Though relatively new among digital marketing tactics, push notifications have shown incredible potential.</p>

<p>Push notifications can be sent across any variety of device or operating system. While most people connect the idea of a push notification to mobile applications, this efficient marketing method has found its way into the world of desktop computing.</p>

<p><strong>Thus, Chrome push notifications.</strong></p>

<p>Not only do push notifications provide yet another means of communicating directly with your audience, but they’re actually better than many other methods, including email!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/">CrazyEgg</a> founder and marketing whizz Neil Patel explains how <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/push-notifications/">push notifications bypass algorithms</a>.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">"What's cool about push notifications is that anytime someone visits your website you can ask them to subscribe to your site. Each time someone clicks on it, you get traffic to your site,”<strong>says Patel</strong>. "But here is the best part: not only do you not have to deal with any algorithms, but you also don’t have to worry about people missing your push notification either."</span></p>

<p>Push notifications enable you to bypass those pesky algorithms employed by social media and search engines, ensuring your audience sees every post you deliver.</p>

<p>However, choosing the right tool to send Chrome push notifications is not that easy as there are thousands of options to choose from. Some of them might be better known than others, but in terms of functionality, it can be difficult to separate the more popular brands.</p>
