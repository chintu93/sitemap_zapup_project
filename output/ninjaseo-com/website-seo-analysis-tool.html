                    <p>SEO is becoming a priority for businesses and companies that haven‚Äôt adopted this practice must do so if they are to stay current and experience continuous growth. Otherwise, they would get lost in the digital noise and grossly undermine their marketing efforts especially at a time such as this when we are experiencing exponential digital growth. Companies are using their websites to do so much more than we give them credit for.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has presented us with a new normal, which includes shopping online exclusively. Post-pandemic, there is a high likelihood that this new normal is here to stay as people shop from the comfort of their homes. Businesses must thus ensure that their audience can easily find them on the search engine results page. </p>

<p><strong><em>A pre-COVID <a href="https://joelhouse.com.au/blog/seo-statistics/">study</a> carried out by Joel House Search Media found that search result information will send 70% of consumers to a physical store. This just goes to show the importance of tapping onto the power of SEO to increase your company‚Äôs ranking. And it gets interesting, did you know that 92% of searchers will pick businesses on the first page of local search results? This is according to HubSpot Marketing <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/local-seo-stats">Statistics</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>However, it is one thing to be easily found and another thing altogether to offer your site‚Äôs visitors a seamless online experience. Your website has to be user friendly if it is to serve its purpose. For many businesses, websites are online shops where customers can buy goods and services on offer.</p>

<p>But how will you know that your site is not only easy to find in the interwebs but also easy to use? The answer lies in SEO audit and you can do this effectively using SERP analysis tools. Such tools probe vital SEO components and the data gathered will aid you to map a prioritized tactic to improve organic search ranking. The SEO auditing process may be daunting and time-consuming, but it is a necessary procedure as search engine algorithms are constantly being updated. </p>

Backlinks are internal and external links leading visitors and search engines to various parts of your page. While evaluating backlinks, consider anchor texts, link quality, and referring domain. Content includes meta-information accessed by search engines and content viewers, images, and words. It also consists of blog posts, page title tags, and a landing page.</p>

<p>Technical SEO on the other hand entails website and server optimizations that improve search engine friendliness, crawl, and index data of your webpage.
