                    <p>Websites have come to play a critical role in many businesses as people are finding it more convenient to shop in the comfort of their homes. Companies must thus stay on top of the game – literally - with their sites if they are to maintain a competitive edge, and search engine optimization (SEO) has proven to be the goose that lays the golden eggs.</p>

<p>The buyer’s journey often starts with a need that the buyer wants to fulfil. In this digital era, many potential buyers are likely to search for the service or product online. Research has shown that these buyers are likely to buy from businesses that appear on the first page of SERP and the higher you rank on this page, the more likely that the buyer will purchase from you.</p>

<p>This is where SEO comes in. Statistics give us a sneak peek into the relevance of this business practice. A <a href="https://99firms.com/blog/seo-statistics/#gref">research report</a> from 99FIRMS indicates that businesses in the US spent $65 billion in 2016 on search engine optimization. The value rose to $79 billion in 2018 and projected that the spending would be over $80 billion in 2021.
The study further explains that 75% of users do not scroll past the first five pages of the SERPs. The US has an estimated 239 million search engine users, that is why search engines generate 10 times more traffic to shopping sites compared to social media sites. *</p>

<p>Quote snippet - <span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white"><strong><em>A recent study by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273957/number-of-digital-buyers-in-the-united-states/">Statista</a> revealed that in 2020, “there were a total of 256 million digital buyers in the United States. This figure is projected to increase to 278.33 million online buyers in 2024. The most popular online shopping categories in the United States include fashion, electronics, and media.”</em></strong></span></p>

<p>To capture this market, regular search engine optimization practices including speed optimization, putting in relevant keywords in the blog content and descriptions, among others is crucial. </p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that SEO is not a one-time affair as search engines keep updating their algorithms. Your website thus needs to be up-to-date with these dynamics. To guarantee you a place at the top pages, regular optimization and audit of your website are paramount. That is why you need an SEO site checker with a reputation of delivering top results such as Ninja SEO to simplify the SEO process for you.</p>

<p><strong><em>Have a solid content building strategy.</em></strong> All SEO processes commence with search engines obtaining data about your business. The selected keywords and phrases are what search engines should find and your goals will be to optimize the keywords in your message. Be creative in the delivery of your message to keep your audience hooked and always coming back for more.</p>

<p><strong><em>Do not forget the back end.</em></strong> Check your title, meta description, alt image text, and slug before you share your content. You can spend a lot of time and finance in developing content, however, search engines might not pick up on selected keywords. Checking your back end eliminates such circumstances.</p>
