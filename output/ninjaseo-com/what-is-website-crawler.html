                    <p>Web crawler is an internet bot that systematically browses the world wide web typically for the purpose of web indexing. “Web crawlers go by many names, including spiders, robots, and bots, and these descriptive names sum up what they do — they crawl across the World Wide Web to index pages for search engines” – Tianna Haas further asks the question; what is website crawler?</p>

<p>AIDM answered the question "what is crawling in SEO?" in their <a href="http://twitter.com/aidmindia/status/540409265580539904?s=21">Tweet</a> , stating that, When Search engines's Spider/crawler searches your website in the internet, then the process called crawling.</p>

<p>Ranksoldier also further emphasized in a <a href="http://twitter.com/ranksoldier/status/1288752961229860870?s=21">Tweet</a> as well that The search engine crawler is just like robots that read web pages of the website to identify that they are authoritative to rank on SERP or not. They read content and elements present on a website and check for their relevancy with one another.</p>

<p>Web crawling software is used by web search engines and some other websites to update their web content or indices of other site’s web content. Web crawlers copy pages for processing by a web engine that highlights the downloaded pages so that users can search more efficiently.</p>

<h1>How website crawlers’ work</h1>

Issues of schedule, load, and “politeness” come in to play when large collections of pages are accessed the number of internet pages is extremely large: even when the largest crawlers fall short of making a compete index in this search engines struggle to give relevant search results in the early years of the world wide web but today relevant results are given almost instantly.</p>

<p>Crawlers can validate hyperlinks and <strong>HTML</strong> codes. They can also be used for web scraping in data-driven programming.</p>
