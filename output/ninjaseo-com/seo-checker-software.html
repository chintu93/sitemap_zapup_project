                    <p>Search engine optimization is very vital in making a website more noticeable online and, hence, drive more traffic. Here are a few pointers on the best on-page SEO checker tools for your website.</p>

<p>One thing about SEO most consultants, freelancers, agency owners and clients can agree on is that it can take a lot of time to see success with an SEO strategy.</p>

<p>That’s why there are so many technical SEO tools, link building guides and blog posts about keyword research to help make the various SEO tasks much easier to manage.</p>

<p>On-page SEO is no different. This type of search engine optimization comprises keyword analysis, online content creation, and keyword optimization.</p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">However, according to <a href="https://www.weblinkspark.com/40-best-seo-quotes-to-get-inspiration/">Rand Fishkin</a>, “On-page SEO is no longer satisfied by raw keyword use. Matching keywords to searcher INTENT is critical.”</span>  </p>

<p>It is a critical part of success to any SEO campaign, and there are several elements you need to manage—checking meta tags, optimizing headings, writing content for SEO, and more.</p>

<p>This is a quick breakdown on the best on-page SEO checker tools, their features, their pricing, and more.</p>

<h2>On-Page SEO and Off Page SEO</h2>

<p>First, it is important to understand the difference between on- and off-page SEO.</p>

<p>Anything that is “on-page” refers to the SEO factors that occur on your website at the page-level. You have direct control over every SEO element that is on your own pages.</p>

<p>Off-page SEO refers to SEO elements that occur beyond your website. It is all about building backlinks and increasing the website’s authority for search engines.. You don’t always have full control over off-page elements.</p>

<p>While there are tools for both, this guide will only cover on-page SEO checker tools.</p>

<h2>Why Is On-Page SEO Important?</h2>

<p>On-page SEO is important because it is how you control how search engines and users see the content on your web pages.</p>

<p>It affects how your pages appear in Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), it helps search engines understand your pages when it crawls them, and so on.</p>

<p>You can think of on-page SEO as being the introductory sales pitch from your business to Google and your target audience. Having a website that is highly optimized helps you rank better for target keywords, increase traffic, and earn more backlinks.</p>

<h2>The Most Important Elements of On-Page SEO</h2>

<p>While there are several important parts of on-page SEO, there are a few that are more essential than others. The best on-page SEO checker tools will be what helps you optimize your pages for these:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Content:</strong> writing high quality and relevant content for target and semantic keywords</li>
<li><strong>Internal links:</strong> adding links to other relevant pages on your website</li>
<li><strong>Keywords:</strong> including keywords in the content, meta tags, heading tags, etc</li>
<li><strong>Mobile friendliness:</strong> having a page that looks good and is fully functional on phones</li>
<li><strong>Page speed:</strong> having a page that loads quickly</li>
</ul>

<p>If a tool also helps you with less important factors, you can consider that a bonus. But if you only have so much money to spend on tools, always pick the ones that help you in these areas.</p>
