<h2>How to easily conduct an SEO audit</h2>

<p>Search engine algorithms are constantly being upgraded and you keep on adding content to your site to make it active. To ensure your brand's site is up-to-date with these changes, it is vital to regularly conduct an SEO audit. </p>

<p>Here’s how you can get started with your SEO audit. </p>

<p><strong>1        Competitor research.</strong> Begin your audit by scrutinizing your competitors. Look at how they are generating their organic search traffic for certain keywords. This will help you know what they are not doing so that you could generate content to surpass them. A competitor analysis could be easily done with an SEO auditing tool such as Ninja SEO. 
The main areas to look into are competitor keywords, their estimated monthly search traffic, inbound links, and domain authority among others. These statistics need to be evaluated and compared to help you figure out how much content competing sites are churning, and their weaknesses and strengths. With this knowledge, you will understand where to focus your strengths.</p>

<p><strong>2        Crawling and indexing.</strong> Crawling is determining how your website is read by search engines while indexing is adding your web page to search engine results. Indexing and crawling are vital to a successful SEO approach. Leveraging a proper SEO analysis tool will help you establish whether your site is being crawled or indexed. 
The robots.txt file is helpful when trying to comprehend what content is blacklisted from crawlers and evaluating the sitemap to see if it meets all requirements. You might be surprised to discover that the entire website has been blacklisted by a search engine. Most sites contain information that is not useful for SEO operation and search engines mostly ignore them.</p>

<p><strong>3        Accessibility.</strong> One of the reasons that damage visitors’ access to your site is slow loading times and 404 errors. Site speed in the SEO industry is increasingly vital. Search engines rank slow sites very poorly; speed is a major UX signal for search engines. Slow load time frustrates readers and search engines. Ensure you check the speed of the entire website. Most clients check the homepage speed and they forget that is just a page and the entire website is the book. 
Also, analyze your competitor's site speed and compare it with yours. Most crucially, measure both the desktop loading time and mobile site speed. This will give you an in-depth report on your site performance in terms of speed and suggest what errors to eliminate to improve your site visibility to search engines and functioning.</p>

<p><strong>4        Link analysis.</strong> Search engines use relevant links as one of the major determinants in ranking websites. Determine how the site is linked both externally and internally to reputable third-party sites. Ninja SEO and Google Search Console are some of the incredible tools that can analyze links in your website and determine what pages linked to yours are important and how your data is linked. It could be backlinks or referring domains. 
Domains are a much stronger signal than backlinks since one site generating 10,000 backlinks is still one referring domain. It is easier to manipulate a site for backlinks but harder to get numerous domains. When analyzing links to your site, referring domains and backlinks should all be evaluated as spam links influence website performance - weed them out.</p>

<p><strong>5        Keyword analysis.</strong> Audit what keywords can generate high-value organic search traffic on your content and determine where these keywords rank your brand. Understand the keywords bringing traffic and how the traffic is converting to clients. Auditing tools help you understand how keyword ranking affects your site performance.</p>

<p><strong>6        Content evaluation.</strong> Your content should be based on what interests your audience. Audit your content to determine what value they are adding to your brand. Know what pages are generating high-value traffic and how to leverage this information to boost your website performance. 
Auditing will provide actionable data about content optimized for target keywords, time spent by visitors engaging on specific content, duplicate content issues, meta description, target keywords, among others. 
Use the report to develop an SEO strategy that has an action plan for your content creation. This information will help you understand what competing firms are not doing and could improve your brands’ understanding of what areas to focus on.</p>

<p><strong>7        On-page optimization.</strong> Auditing on-page includes looking at header tags, missing elements in pages, page title length, URL, and ALT tags on images. </p>

<p><strong>8        Site design and architecture.</strong> The goal of search engines is to ensure clients get a safe and enjoyable experience. To keep up, brands should evaluate customers' behavior and experience. Improve customer experience by ensuring your site is mobile-friendly, secured HTTPS, and easy navigation. These are key areas that search engines use to rank websites, negative reports injure your online visibility and website performance.</p>

<p><strong>10        Execution.</strong> Once you point out areas that require action, do not hesitate to find solutions. The primary goal of an SEO audit is to find what interferes with your website performance; however, it should be geared on priorities. Take action on recommendations based on how crucial they are, and ensure all recommendations are looked into eventually.
