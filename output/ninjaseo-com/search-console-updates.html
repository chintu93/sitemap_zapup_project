<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/google-search-console-update-february2020.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="google search console update feb-2020" /></p>

<p><strong>Change of Address Features – 19-02-2020</strong></p>

<p>In February 2020, Google made updates to the site address within the new search console. This update is within the search settings of each web property and comes with a few additional features. This includes changes within the change of address section to show whether the address change has been successful or otherwise. This change is critical when a website decides to alter its domain name or shift the subdomain to a different location.</p>

<p>Once the change of address has been initiated using the appropriate tool, Google will make it a priority to index the new address of the site and ignore the old address. This should happen gradually over time.</p>

<p>Once the redirects have been instituted, this should be the 301 Redirect, the webmasters will use the change of address tool located in the search console to notify Google Crawlers of the shift to the new domain or subdomain. </p>

<p><strong>Google Search Console Update- Redirect Validation</strong></p>

With this update on Redirect Validation that has been added to the search console, webmasters will get a clear picture on the top 5 URLs of the domain. This means having a successful 301 redirect. </p>

<p><strong>Google Search Console Update - On-screen Reminder</strong></p>

<p>Even with the update on the Validation Request, it still takes Google a couple of months to redirect the entire ranking signals from an old website to a new one. Approximately a successful redirect should take about 180 days for the whole process to go through and all the signals to be passed. This also varies based on the number of pages on the site and the number of backlinks that have been generated.
With this recent Google update webmasters will begin to get a reminder or notification on the console dashboard regarding the process. This may be a signal such as “The site is currently migrating to www.xyz.com.” This should last for the entire migration period.</p>

<p>However, this feature is restricted for those who are new to SEO. This means that this 301 redirect tool may not be implemented on such a website. In this case, it has to be implemented as part of the Google Search Console directly within the website before the Change of Address feature can be used. </p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/google-search-review-update-february2022.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="google search console update january-2020" /></p>

<p>The review snippet functions as a Clink-Through magnet due to star rating and other similar features.  With this update webmasters will be able to troubleshoot the markup implementation. As announced by Google, they will also be able to review the markup code prior to going live. However, this feature will only be available to sites that have implemented the review markup on the console dashboard. This will allow users to view warnings, notifications, and errors, for markup that have been implemented on the site. </p>

<p>Additionally, this enhancement feature on the review snippet will show up on the Performance Report filter to help the webmasters to have a better understanding on the performance of the review snippet. This will be done using filters.</p>

<h2><strong>Google Search Console Update in January 2020</strong></h2>
