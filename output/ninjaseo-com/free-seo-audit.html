<h3>1. Google Analytics</h3>

<p>While some may argue that Google analytics is not actually a true SEO tool the fact remains that making use of labels and different means of classification doesn‚Äôt actually do justice to the role Google analytics plays in website SEO audit.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to do anything around SEO audit without using Google analytics. It provides accurate and concise data like bounce rate, traffic sources, page speed, etc. which helps to show how well your SEO efforts are paying off. In this <a href="http://twitter.com/googleanalytics/status/1339367599352766472?s=21">Tweet</a>, Google analytics emphasizes in the importance of insights drawn from accurate data stating that "As companies seek to create a data-driven culture, too much of the focus is being spent on capturing data and not enough on uncovering insights."</p>

<p>SEO audit doesn‚Äôt come better than what Google analytics offers in that the data and information which it provides lets you know if your current SEO efforts are actually paying off. It lets you know where you actually stand in the larger picture of things.</p>

<p>To obtain even more explosive results, Google analytics tool can be linked with the Google search console so they work hand in hand combining the insights gathered to know which way to go in the process of increasing organic traffic.</p>
