<h2>Why your brand needs to invest in SEO</h2>

<p>SEO is the process of optimizing a website to generate unpaid traffic from search engines, thus increasing the quality and quantity of the site traffic. This optimization requires making a necessary alteration to your content and design so that it ranks among the top pages of search engine results. </p>

<p>Here are some of the top reasons why your business should consider investing in SEO;</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It is cost-friendly.</strong> SEO return on investment is generally higher compared to other forms of digital marketing such as social media marketing, PPC advertising, and purchasing leads for an email marketing program. PPC advertising generates more income while social media is a perfect image creator and enhancer, however, the bedrock of brands’ online presence in many ways is SEO.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smart investment in uncertain times.</strong> SEO is an investment paying dividends for years. Furthermore, organic traffic generates 40% of your online marketing revenue as per BrightEdge. Over the COVID-19 lockdown period, most businesses that thrived did their operations online.

<li><p><strong>Not having a healthy content profile is bad for business.</strong> Search engines continuously change their search algorithms and how their website looks. Creating a healthy content profile will boost your business search engine results as it is one of the factors search engines evaluate when ranking sites. This is what is referred to as on-site SEO.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Competitors are already using SEO.</strong> Ignoring this priceless marketing strategy will let your competitors outmaneuver you. If you want to succeed in online marketing, having a SEO strategy is vital as it boosts your search engine results.</p></li>

<h2>How to improve your SEO</h2>

<p>One of the ways to ensure you are utilizing your content online is by refining your search engine optimization strategy. In the modern combative business world, brands have to analyze and interpret their SEO strategy to be a step forward from their competitors. </p>

<h3>Integrate Ninja SEO into your website.</h3>

</ul>

<p>Furthermore, it helps you know what browser your clients are using, the most popular device used to visit your site, referral traffic, and understanding your competitors.</p>

<p><strong>Identify low performing content and refine them with relevant trending topic and keywords</strong> that users want. 
<strong><em><a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/">Google</a> now processes over 40,000 search queries every second on average, which translates to over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide.</em></strong></p>

<p>Create content that is engaging, and you are a step close to high-ranking content. Follow trends and conversations that boost your content creation. Meaning, at some point, you should revisit low performing content. Once you identify pages that need refining, replace them with new keywords. Your website SEO checker could suggest some for you. Sooner or later, this will improve your content, save you the time you spend developing new content, and boost your content ranking. Consider the audience's interest to help you create engaging content they will be interested to read.</p>

<h3>Ensure your content is developed around a primary keyword and relevant keywords.</h3>

<p>Researching keywords to use in developing your content will help create a mind map for your content and aid you to understand what your audience would be interested to read. Comprehending what keywords will intrigue your audience and content creation will help you boost your website SEO. Create content with a natural flow. Identify semantically related keywords to your primary keyword target to help you develop content with keywords that naturally pop in. </p>

<p>Target question keywords to improve your SEO since it mimics what most humans do in the search engines. Try utilizing keywords or key phrases that include question indicators such as who, why, what, where, when, and how. This creates a conversational tone and will improve your search engine results.</p>

<h3>Expand your backlink portfolio.</h3>

<p>SEO mainly deals with backlinks and whether your backlinks are generated from high authority sites. A good rating in this takes you a step closer to the front page compared to following tips about on-page technical SEO. Diversity can be sourced in two ways; one is through the type of backlink (dofollow and nofollow), and two the site where the backlinks originate. </p>

<p>A diversified backlink portfolio signals search engines that your page is an authoritative source and that your links are generated naturally and not by spam. Grow your backlink portfolio by looking for directories in your niche, ensuring your content is shareable, and creating newsworthy content, and reaching out to publishers.</p>

<h3>Make sure your site is mobile friendly.</h3>

<p>The majority of Google searches come from mobile devices. This is a good enough reason to make you optimize your website for them. Search engines such as Google reward clients' webpages that are optimized for mobile users. With incredible SEO tools available, you are now able to research and compare mobile and desktop keywords separately. </p>

<p>This tool provides mobile analytics that will impact decision making in ways that improve audience engagement and keywords. Consider creating short and sweet content that tide over the gap between desktop monitors and small mobile screens. Also, place most engaging and educative content toward the front page so that it will load first. Lastly, target readers with keywords that are optimized for mobile.</p>

<h3>Decrease load time on the top-performing webpage.</h3>

<p>Most high bounce rates are mainly caused by slow loading time. Like google puts it, "speed equals revenue", this means that fast loading pages are more likely to get more clicks compared to slow loading pages. Your SEO ranking is impacted by loading speed. Audit your webpage to comprehend what is the loading speed of your webpage. Speed auditing will suggest the best ways to fix the reason why your page is slow loading. Besides, it also scans for common errors that can be fixed to improve your speed and boost your SEO ranking.</p>

<h3>Continually learn from your analysis.</h3>
