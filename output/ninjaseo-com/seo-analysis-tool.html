<h2>Types of SEO analysis</h2>

<p><strong>Technical SEO analysis</strong> relates to non-content elements of your websites and is aimed at improving a site’s readability. It involves strategies that improve a site's back-end structure and foundation. Easy readability makes it easy for search engines to understand the site while crawling over it as well as improving user experience. A good user experience is also important for readers and can affect overall traffic and engagement rates. 
Factors considered in this type of SEO include the speed of the site, how mobile-friendly it is, crawlability, its architecture, how code is structured, indexing, and security (SSL and HTTPS). Inefficient code slows down site load time and will be ranked lower compared to a site with efficient code. </p>

<p>On-page optimization is better received when the website code is minimized. Inefficient code dilutes on-page content. Technical SEO analysis checks if the website adapts to the device being used to view the page. Security is also very important because search engines such as Google will rank SSL protected websites than those that are not. This information can be retrieved from an SEO audit tool by inputting your website then receiving a report on the status of multiple technical elements along with instructions for how to resolve issues if you have any.</p>

<p><strong>On-page SEO analysis.</strong> Relates to content on your page and involves strategies to optimize one page to rank higher on SERPs. Factors included in this SEO analysis are keyword research, page title and meta-description, keyword optimization, and content creation. </p>

<p>Keyword research involves finding the best keywords to target. Keyword optimization involves placing keywords in all the correct places. On-page content involves creating high-quality target content that is focused on the target keyword and provides value to the visitors. Your website should include your primary keyword in both the tile and meta-description to help Google understand the semantics of your page. The page title and meta description helps differentiate your page from that of your competitors. The intriguing page title will engage visitors and therefore increase click-through rate and reduces bounce rates.</p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/seo-analysis-tool-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Types of SEO analysis" /></p>

<p><strong>Off-page SEO analysis.</strong> It is aimed at increasing a website's domain authority and Google’s interpretation of the site. It involves activities outside of your website that helps boost the ranking of your page. Domain authority is a measure of a site's credibility and its ability to rank high in search engines. It includes aspects such as backlink building, social media usage, and local citation directories and sites.</p>

<h2>How to perform SEO analysis using SEO analysis tools</h2>

<p>While determining how to use SEO analysis tools, it is important to learn the steps before the stage and the actions taken during the analysis. The steps in performing SEO analysis include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keyword analysis. As much as great content is valuable, if you do not make use of the right keywords, no one will get to see your content. Before identifying your SEO competition, it is important to do an SEO keyword research that will be the foundation of your SEO strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify and analyze your top competitors. Your competitors are companies that rank high in your keyword search. Focus on 3 to 5 top sites. Analyze from your competition their strategy for visitor-to-leads conversion, their domain age, mobile-friendliness, are they using HTTP or HTTPS, primary calls-to-action, their service area, and social media presence. Develop a strategy that will help you boost your search performance, mobile performance, and page load speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Social media and content audit. Evaluate your competitors' blogs, Facebook page, Twitter, LinkedIn profiles, and Pinterest account. Check their engagement ratio, how often they share updates, and the number of active followers.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine your strategy. Use the data and insights from your competitor analysis to develop your strategy based on the number of backlinks you need to acquire, number of internal links, number of articles to share, and what keywords to focus on.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Use your SEO analysis tool to do the following:**</h2>

<h3>1. Check your baseline score and visibility on Google.</h3>

<p>To gain a better understanding of your overall website visibility, the first step is to check how your website ranks on Google by identifying the number of web pages ranked on the search engine, and its average position in the SERP. This will help in your online marketing strategy.</p>

<h3>2. Check URLs and meta-descriptions.</h3>

<p>Use SEO analysis tools such as Ninja SEO to check for irrelevant URLS and meta-descriptions. Optimize irrelevant URLs by shortening them to about 4 to 5 words that describe the content on the page. Optimize URLs by summarizing what your page is about and including both primary and secondary keywords.</p>

<h3>3. Evaluate incoming links/backlinks.</h3>

<p>Incoming links, also known as backlinks, help you see who is linking to you and insights on how to improve your ranking. Backlinks are links to your website which have been hyperlinked on another website. They help in ranking your page highly since they are an indicator of the trustworthiness of your site. </p>

<p><strong><em>According to digital marketer Rio Rodrigues, “Google and other major search engines think about backlinks “votes” for a specific page.” (https://twitter.com/RiaRodriques/status/1340587014899449856)</em></strong></p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Backlinks area unit links from 1 website to a page on other websites. Google and other major search engines think about backlinks “votes” for a specific page. If you want to know more then visit <a href="https://t.co/QUe5I4Fm7E">https://t.co/QUe5I4Fm7E</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/backlinks?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#backlinks</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SEO</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigitalMarketing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DigitalMarketing</a> <a href="https://t.co/NkpY07X428">pic.twitter.com/NkpY07X428</a></p>&mdash; Ria Rodriques (@RiaRodriques) <a href="https://twitter.com/RiaRodriques/status/1340587014899449856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Backlinks are thus an important aspect of website optimization. </p>

<p><strong><em>However, <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-traffic-study/">research</a> from Ahref shows that 91% of all websites never receive organic traffic from Google due to not having backlinks.</em></strong></p>

<p>To check your back-link profile, enter your domain name into the SEO analysis tool. It will bring back information on back-links from other sites, URL rating, domain rating, and referring domains. </p>

<p>Domain rating indicates the authority that a website has on the internet based on backlinks it has from other sites. URL rating indicates the authority of specific pages which is based on backlinks and its hosting domain authority. The results also indicate backlink growth (progress in acquiring new links), broken links, link intersects which shows a site linking to various other sites of the same niche, and back-link anchor text.</p>

<h3>4. Check titles and headings.</h3>

<p>Ensure that your title and heading grab the attention of visitors by using your choice of SEO keywords. Instead of using high volume keywords that are very competitive, use their less competitive long-tail keyword counter-parts to improve your chances of ranking better.</p>

<h3>5. Check your page load speed.</h3>

<p>SEO analysis tools can help you identify your page loading speed which not only affects your search engine rating but also affects your user experience. Visitors will bounce your site if it takes too long to load. Page load speed test will indicate if there are any problems with coding and optimization. These can be fixed at the back-end of your website by optimizing images or minimizing JavaScript, CSS, or HTML code.</p>

<h3>6. Analyze your internal links.</h3>

<p>Internal links are added to pages on your website to help visitors in navigating the various pages on your website hence improving user experience. Internal linking is the process of strategically adding these internal links to various pages of your websites, keeping in mind keywords and anchor text. You can add these links to both older and newer websites as long as the links direct visitors to relevant information.</p>

<h3>7. Check your spam score.</h3>

<p>SEO links help you see the websites that have linked to you and give your spam score. Spam score increases when you have backlinks to low-authority websites. These low-quality backlinks can be removed by disavowing the links or asking the webmaster of the particular website to remove them.</p>

<h3>8. Analyze your web content.</h3>

<p>Content IQ analysis is done to analyze the quality of your data by checking how your content ranks to your chosen keyword, identify missing meta-data, and unoptimized keywords. Website content affects how visitors engage with you and in turn, affects traffic rates.</p>

<h3>9. Check for broken links.</h3>

<p>Broken links give a negative user experience and will lead to high bounce rates. To fix broken links, ensure proper spelling for your website URL or do a 301 redirect to another relevant URL.</p>

<h3>10. Audit images.</h3>

<p>SEO analysis helps you identify unclear images or those that do not load properly. You can optimize images by reducing their size through compression and/or use proper alt text. Alt-text is used to clearly describe the appearance and function of the image.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>SEO analysis, which is akin to a health checkup, is a critical process in your overall SEO strategy. SEO analysis can help you improve the content around your keywords, ensuring links are working, optimizes your site speed to be above the recommended 2.5 seconds, and keeping your spam score down by ensuring you have backlinks to high-authority websites. An effective SEO analysis requires a powerful SEO analysis tool.</p>
