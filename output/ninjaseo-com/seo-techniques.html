<p>Here are some tips on how:</p>

<p>a. Write quality content</p>

<ul>
<li>This ranks high on the list of top SEO techniques. It encompasses great ideas, error-free spelling and grammar and compelling delivery. </li>
<li>Use Shorter paragraphs: Generally 3-4 sentence paragraphs are adequate. It could even be one line. But note that an idea or thought should be kept within on paragraph so that it doesn’t get fragmented and lost.</li>
<li>Mixed sentence lengths: Though long sentences can be hard to follow especially on a mobile device or computer, they work excellently when used sparingly. Here’s how you should vary your writing: </li>
<li>Sub-headers: Informative sub-headers as the average reader will scan through a piece in 37 seconds.</li>
<li>Bullet points: If your ideas in a paragraph are more than 3, use bullet points (illustrated here!)</li>
<li>White space: As too much white space will overwhelm visitors, leading to increased bounce rates, break it up by adding relevant media such as photographs, graphs and videos.</li>

Here is a YouTube explainer video that gives extra tips on how to create content that ranks.</li>
</ul>

<p>b) Learn the Art of Bucket Brigades to Enhance the Flow
Originally, the term “bucket brigade” was used to refer to people lined up to pass buckets of water when putting out a fire. It has become copywriting technique to keep a readers interest.</p>

<p>Bucket brigade in writing is a cleverly thought out cluster of words used to pique a readers interest and keep the flow. Usually, the bridging flow ends with a colon.</p>

<p>Examples of bucket brigades are: </p>

<ul>
<li>General bucket brigades
"Do I have your attention?"
"Think about that for a minute…"
"I know the feeling:”
"OK, I know what you're thinking:"</li>
<li>Introductory bucket brigades:
"Do you want to learn how to…?"
"Have you ever found yourself…?"
"Imagine what it would be like:"
"Have you wondered why…?"</li>
<li>Content body bucket brigades:
"Let's get started:"
"Let's dig a little deeper:”
"Let me explain:"
"Let me show you how:"</li>
<li>Conclusion bucket brigades:
"In short:"
"Let's recap:"
"In a nutshell:"
"But don't take my word for it:"</li>
</ul>

<p>c)        Learn How To Incorporate the Inverted Pyramid Writing Style
This method advocates for giving the bulk of important information at the beginning of the article. Readers who only scan articles rarely get to the end, so it makes sense to give them the information straight up.
Google knows this so we consider it a top SEO technique as well.</p>

<h2>SEO Technique 2: Improve User Experience (UX) on Web Pages</h2>

<p>After you have clearly defined your search engine’s optimum goals, you will need to track the components that are working and those that are not.
You can start with Ninja SEO which offers a wide range of software tools that help to improve the user experience. This tool is absolutely free!
Analytics software such as Google Analytics, Google Search Console, can help you with this tracking. </p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-improve-user-experience-web-pages.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="improve user-experience" /></p>

<p>Other tools such as Crazy Egg will also show you the visits to your site and how your visitors navigate away, enabling you to improve your own sites’ user experience. 
These web analytics should be in place even before you direct your first customer to your landing page or site. </p>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 3: Increase Website Speed</strong></h2>

<p>A slow site says that something is off about your credibility. Period.
Page speed is of utmost importance, both to the users and to search engines. 40% of people will abandon a website if it does not load in 3 seconds. Another survey determined that almost 70% of consumers would not be willing to buy from a slow site. </p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-increase-website-speed.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="increase website speed" /></p>

<p>On Google, site speed ranks very high and will affect the ability of your site to appear on Google search results. Google has thus introduced top SEO techniques to assist you improve your speed site speeds that include:</p>

<ul>
<li>PageSpeed Insights help developers to improve their site performance</li>
<li>Accelerated Mobile Pages Project helps boost mobile site speeds</li>
<li>est My Site assists in gauging the responsiveness and user friendliness of a site. 
This includes speed. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to speed up your website and rank better with more conversations do these things: </p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce unnecessary code </li>
<li>Defer JavaScript loading</li>
<li>Reduce the server response time</li>
<li>Choose the optimum hosting option to meet your needs</li>
<li>Enable browser caching</li>
<li>Enable compression</li>
<li>Compress images to reduce page size up to 30-40%</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 4: Optimize for Voice Search</strong></h2>

<p>With 77% of adults in the US now owning smartphones and more than 70% using a smart speaker, this is a bandwagon you cannot afford to not be on.
It is important to understand however that voice searches work quite differently from text searches.
Voice searches are more likely to be a question and be locally based. So it is advisable to write featured snippets as they are likely to pop up in the case of voice searches too. </p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-optimize-for-voice-search.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="optimize for voice search" /></p>

<p>Here are a couple of other points worth bearing in mind when optimizing for voice search:</p>

<p>a) Use Long-Tail Keywords</p>

<p>Long tail refers to terms with three words or more. 
For a chance at ranking for those longer keywords, you’ll need to create content that targets them on your website using this process:</p>

<p>To rank high in your area, write a comprehensive, long-form blog post which suitably positions semantically related keywords all through. </p>

<ul>
<li>Aim also to create content that’s significantly better than the content that’s currently ranking for your target keyword. Find lots of semantically related keywords and include them in your blog.</li>
<li>Format the content for readability, using questions as subheadings where appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>This top SEO technique will greatly boost your website ranking.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Structured Data
As a whopping 40% of results for voice searches are gotten from featured snippets. The use of structured data can improve the chances of your information coming up as opposed to a competitor’s.</li>
<li>Several kinds of structured data (also called Schema markup) are used by SEOers. When Google better understands the themes and subject of your page, it will definitely improve your rankings.This, in turn, can help improve rankings.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 5: Design for Mobile First</strong></h2>

<p>A huge chunk of searches, and almost half all purchases now take place on smart phones. <br />
It is said that up-to 79% of smartphone users have made online purchases over the past 6 months and 80% of shoppers look up reviews on products, compare prices or even search for alternative store locations while inside a physical store. 
Though it took some time coming, in March 2020 google announced that it will now use its own mobile smartphone user-agent to crawl sites. </p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-design-for-mobile-first.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="design for mobile first" /></p>

<p>This will mean that your sites’ mobile version will be given priority in crawling and indexing over your desktop version.
This shift in the focus of both customers and google indicates that you should get down to building an awesome mobile experience for your site. </p>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 6: Focus on Topic Clusters Instead of Keywords</strong></h2>

<p>As Google evolves, so does its algorithm and so must SEO techniques. It has now focused its objective on understanding the intention of its users- what they’re searching for, what they expect and if which search results will best answer their queries. 
This is where we find the “featured snippet box” coming into play.
As important as keywords are, they in isolation will not get you to the first page of google. You will also need to focus on the contest around these keywords.
Here’s how:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create audience specific content. This could be as specific as age, location, interests, etc. 
Creating broad content will not win you rankings as it appeals to no one in particular. Narrowing down will help you answer your customers specific needs and create interest for your website.</p></li>
<li><p>Have your content organized into clusters
Have a pillar page, which will contain important pages such as e-commerce and a cluster page which will have related topics and will link back to the pillar page.
This strategy will help the user have a more satisfied experience and thus have your site ranking high on google and who knows….one of those cluster pages could end up ranking even higher than the pillar page and driving hordes of traffic to your site.</p></li>
<li>Don’t forget your keywords 
In as much as this is not the only important factor; it is still a critically important one.
To googles spiders, keywords are glaring signposts.
Keyword research will also help you find out important information on your topics of interest, thus aiding you increase brand recognition. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-focus-on-topic-clusters-instead-of-keywords.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="focus topic clusters instead of keywords" /></p>

<p>To access keyword data, you can use:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ninja SEO Keyword tool</li>
<li>Keyword explorer by Moz</li>
<li>SEMrush</li>
<li>Ahrefs</li>
</ol>

<p>When considering your keyword tool of choice, look out for on that allows you to monitor high volumes broken down into relevant themes. Additionally, to should allow you to track your competitors of all scales.</p>

<p><strong>How Do You Use Ninja SEO’s Keyword tool?</strong></p>

<p>NinjaSEO’s “Keyword Search” tab is quite comprehensive all on its own. When the key phrase/word you wish to rank for is input, it immediately lists the pages in SERP that are most suitable for ranking in relation to that particular keyword.
If you are looking for ideas for keywords themselves, just type a thought into google and it will give you relevant keyword ideas.
This is another top SEO technique that will sour your ranking on Google search engines.</p>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 7: Write Longer Content (Mostly)</strong></h2>

<p>Generally, longer content is likely to attract more backlinks which could eventually translate to increased traffic and higher rankings on Google.
Longer content tends to inspire more backlinks that could translate to more traffic and better rankings.  However, not only are 2,000+ word blog posts hard to write, very rarely will a user read through all of it.
That said a longer post is likely to have more information and thus target more users’ individual queries.</p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-write-longer-content-mostly.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="write-longer-content-mostly" /></p>

<p>If you have old content that already has a following, you can just update it, making it more current and updating features like SEO which are constantly evolving. 
To find out how much traffic your content is receiving in “the Landing Pages section” of Google Analytics., Go to Behavior &gt; Site Content &gt; Landing Pages:
Once there, change the segment to “Organic Traffic,” and use your search bar to filter the results. For example, to view traffic in the x /blog subfolder segment of your site, key in x/blog on the search bar.</p>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 8: Create a Diverse Backlink Portfolio</strong></h2>

<p>Though some links are unsafe to use, you can use links which are earned through high quality content, influencer marketing and outreach. 
Not only are these links safe, they are also very effective. 
A spanner in the works is that Google msy flag sites with high-quality profiles in their link backlinks for a manual review.</p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-create-diverse-backlink-portfolio.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="create diverse backlink portfolio" /></p>

<p>Thankfully, this rarely happens as organic growth dictates that you will pick up both big and small links along the way, looking natural to search engines.
Additionally, you can help your link profile by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Targeting small sites as well as “big hitters” when promoting content. Smaller sites are usually niche-specific and more responsive and will improve your ranking considerably.</li>
<li>Do not disavow too many sites as you will get yourself discounted. Google already understands that some bad links will be picked by your status and will ignore them.
High quality backlinks are essential for high rankings and thus feature among the top SEO techniques. </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 9: Do not Overlook Technical SEO</strong></h2>

<p>A site that’s not technically sound is bound to underperform. <br />
Here are a few tips to ensure your site is SEO compliant:</p>

<ul>
<li>nsure that Your Entire Site Loads on HTTPS, not HTTP, which is not necessarily secure. </li>
<li>Enable AMP  (Accelerated Mobile Pages) for Mobile. AMP pages have a different URL and are served from the Google amp Cache, making them faster to load. They combine the following components:</li>
<li>HTML tags: These aid in quick rendering of web patterns</li>
<li>AMP JS: This is a library which manages best practices for fast rendering and AMP resources. </li>
<li>AMP cache: a content delivery network which both  loads content as well as ensures speed</li>
<li>Invest in Ninja SEO Crawling Software
Similar to Googles on crawlers, SEO crawler programs will give you insights as to how your site is doing technically. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-do-not-overlook-technical-seo.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="do not overlook technical seo" /></p>

<p>The Ninja SEO site crawler is comprehensive and offers superb features in usability, speed, data output, and reporting. 
- Correct Your Semantic Markups
Semantic markups are basically HTML tags that help emphasize your sites’ key information. They communicate to Google’s spiders the essence of a page without having to digest every word.
- Fix “Page Not Found” 404 Errors by Redirecting URLs
You might turn away hundreds pf potential customers with a 404 error. Your Google Analytics dashboard can help you identify how many page views got this error and enable you to fix the issue.
You could also redirect broken pages to other URLs which will boost user experience and regain any link equity you were missing out on.  </p>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 10: Build momentum with social signals</strong></h2>

<p>Though google hasn’t added social signals to its ranking algorithm factors, you cannot afford to ignore them as they should certainly be part of your SEO strategy.
Sounds implausible?
Several case studies have demonstrated the impact of likes, social shares, pins and tweets on search engine rankings. 
Entities that have benefited from Social Media signals are Moz and Shrusti, who moved from a page 400 to a page 1 Google ranking due to social media. </p>

<p>To get social media mileage, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create useful content which will be share-worthy although your social media platforms.</li>
<li>Ensure your posts have visible share buttons.</li>
<li>Ask people to share your content.</li>
<li>Create interest by hosting social media contests.</li>
<li>Mention and link social media influencers on your posts and let them know. These methods and more will definitely boost your social media signals and eventually, your google ranking.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 4: Optimize for Voice Search</strong></h2>

<p>With 77% of adults in the US now owning smartphones and more than 70% using a smart speaker, this is a bandwagon you cannot afford to not be on.
It is important to understand however that voice searches work quite differently from text searches.
Voice searches are more likely to be a question and be locally based. So it is advisable to write featured snippets as they are likely to pop up in the case of voice searches too. </p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-optimize-for-voice-search.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="optimize for voice search" /></p>

<p>Here are a couple of other points worth bearing in mind when optimizing for voice search:</p>

<p>a) Use Long-Tail Keywords</p>

<p>Long tail refers to terms with three words or more. 
For a chance at ranking for those longer keywords, you’ll need to create content that targets them on your website using this process:</p>

<p>To rank high in your area, write a comprehensive, long-form blog post which suitably positions semantically related keywords all through. </p>

<ul>
<li>Aim also to create content that’s significantly better than the content that’s currently ranking for your target keyword. Find lots of semantically related keywords and include them in your blog.</li>
<li>Format the content for readability, using questions as subheadings where appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>This top SEO technique will greatly boost your website ranking.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Structured Data
As a whopping 40% of results for voice searches are gotten from featured snippets. The use of structured data can improve the chances of your information coming up as opposed to a competitor’s.</li>
<li>Several kinds of structured data (also called Schema markup) are used by SEOers. When Google better understands the themes and subject of your page, it will definitely improve your rankings.This, in turn, can help improve rankings.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 5: Design for Mobile First</strong></h2>

<p>A huge chunk of searches, and almost half all purchases now take place on smart phones. <br />
It is said that up-to 79% of smartphone users have made online purchases over the past 6 months and 80% of shoppers look up reviews on products, compare prices or even search for alternative store locations while inside a physical store. 
Though it took some time coming, in March 2020 google announced that it will now use its own mobile smartphone user-agent to crawl sites. </p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-design-for-mobile-first.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="design for mobile first" /></p>

<p>This will mean that your sites’ mobile version will be given priority in crawling and indexing over your desktop version.
This shift in the focus of both customers and google indicates that you should get down to building an awesome mobile experience for your site. </p>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 6: Focus on Topic Clusters Instead of Keywords</strong></h2>

<p>As Google evolves, so does its algorithm and so must SEO techniques. It has now focused its objective on understanding the intention of its users- what they’re searching for, what they expect and if which search results will best answer their queries. 
This is where we find the “featured snippet box” coming into play.
As important as keywords are, they in isolation will not get you to the first page of google. You will also need to focus on the contest around these keywords.
Here’s how:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create audience specific content. This could be as specific as age, location, interests, etc. 
Creating broad content will not win you rankings as it appeals to no one in particular. Narrowing down will help you answer your customers specific needs and create interest for your website.</p></li>
<li><p>Have your content organized into clusters
Have a pillar page, which will contain important pages such as e-commerce and a cluster page which will have related topics and will link back to the pillar page.
This strategy will help the user have a more satisfied experience and thus have your site ranking high on google and who knows….one of those cluster pages could end up ranking even higher than the pillar page and driving hordes of traffic to your site.</p></li>
<li>Don’t forget your keywords 
In as much as this is not the only important factor; it is still a critically important one.
To googles spiders, keywords are glaring signposts.
Keyword research will also help you find out important information on your topics of interest, thus aiding you increase brand recognition. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-focus-on-topic-clusters-instead-of-keywords.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="focus topic clusters instead of keywords" /></p>

<p>To access keyword data, you can use:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ninja SEO Keyword tool</li>
<li>Keyword explorer by Moz</li>
<li>SEMrush</li>
<li>Ahrefs</li>
</ol>

<p>When considering your keyword tool of choice, look out for on that allows you to monitor high volumes broken down into relevant themes. Additionally, to should allow you to track your competitors of all scales.</p>

<p><strong>How Do You Use Ninja SEO’s Keyword tool?</strong></p>

<p>NinjaSEO’s “Keyword Search” tab is quite comprehensive all on its own. When the key phrase/word you wish to rank for is input, it immediately lists the pages in SERP that are most suitable for ranking in relation to that particular keyword.
If you are looking for ideas for keywords themselves, just type a thought into google and it will give you relevant keyword ideas.
This is another top SEO technique that will sour your ranking on Google search engines.</p>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 7: Write Longer Content (Mostly)</strong></h2>

<p>Generally, longer content is likely to attract more backlinks which could eventually translate to increased traffic and higher rankings on Google.
Longer content tends to inspire more backlinks that could translate to more traffic and better rankings.  However, not only are 2,000+ word blog posts hard to write, very rarely will a user read through all of it.
That said a longer post is likely to have more information and thus target more users’ individual queries.</p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-write-longer-content-mostly.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="write-longer-content-mostly" /></p>

<p>If you have old content that already has a following, you can just update it, making it more current and updating features like SEO which are constantly evolving. 
To find out how much traffic your content is receiving in “the Landing Pages section” of Google Analytics., Go to Behavior &gt; Site Content &gt; Landing Pages:
Once there, change the segment to “Organic Traffic,” and use your search bar to filter the results. For example, to view traffic in the x /blog subfolder segment of your site, key in x/blog on the search bar.</p>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 8: Create a Diverse Backlink Portfolio</strong></h2>

<p>Though some links are unsafe to use, you can use links which are earned through high quality content, influencer marketing and outreach. 
Not only are these links safe, they are also very effective. 
A spanner in the works is that Google msy flag sites with high-quality profiles in their link backlinks for a manual review.</p>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-create-diverse-backlink-portfolio.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="create diverse backlink portfolio" /></p>

<p>Thankfully, this rarely happens as organic growth dictates that you will pick up both big and small links along the way, looking natural to search engines.
Additionally, you can help your link profile by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Targeting small sites as well as “big hitters” when promoting content. Smaller sites are usually niche-specific and more responsive and will improve your ranking considerably.</li>
<li>Do not disavow too many sites as you will get yourself discounted. Google already understands that some bad links will be picked by your status and will ignore them.
High quality backlinks are essential for high rankings and thus feature among the top SEO techniques. </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 9: Do not Overlook Technical SEO</strong></h2>

<p>A site that’s not technically sound is bound to underperform. <br />
Here are a few tips to ensure your site is SEO compliant:</p>

<ul>
<li>nsure that Your Entire Site Loads on HTTPS, not HTTP, which is not necessarily secure. </li>
<li>Enable AMP  (Accelerated Mobile Pages) for Mobile. AMP pages have a different URL and are served from the Google amp Cache, making them faster to load. They combine the following components:</li>
<li>HTML tags: These aid in quick rendering of web patterns</li>
<li>AMP JS: This is a library which manages best practices for fast rendering and AMP resources. </li>
<li>AMP cache: a content delivery network which both  loads content as well as ensures speed</li>
<li>Invest in Ninja SEO Crawling Software
Similar to Googles on crawlers, SEO crawler programs will give you insights as to how your site is doing technically. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://ninjaseo.com/images/blog/b-do-not-overlook-technical-seo.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="do not overlook technical seo" /></p>

<p>The Ninja SEO site crawler is comprehensive and offers superb features in usability, speed, data output, and reporting. 
- Correct Your Semantic Markups
Semantic markups are basically HTML tags that help emphasize your sites’ key information. They communicate to Google’s spiders the essence of a page without having to digest every word.
- Fix “Page Not Found” 404 Errors by Redirecting URLs
You might turn away hundreds pf potential customers with a 404 error. Your Google Analytics dashboard can help you identify how many page views got this error and enable you to fix the issue.
You could also redirect broken pages to other URLs which will boost user experience and regain any link equity you were missing out on.  </p>

<h2><strong>SEO Technique 10: Build momentum with social signals</strong></h2>

<p>Though google hasn’t added social signals to its ranking algorithm factors, you cannot afford to ignore them as they should certainly be part of your SEO strategy.
Sounds implausible?
Several case studies have demonstrated the impact of likes, social shares, pins and tweets on search engine rankings. 
Entities that have benefited from Social Media signals are Moz and Shrusti, who moved from a page 400 to a page 1 Google ranking due to social media. </p>

<p>To get social media mileage, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create useful content which will be share-worthy although your social media platforms.</li>
<li>Ensure your posts have visible share buttons.</li>
<li>Ask people to share your content.</li>
<li>Create interest by hosting social media contests.</li>
<li>Mention and link social media influencers on your posts and let them know. These methods and more will definitely boost your social media signals and eventually, your google ranking.</li>
</ul>
