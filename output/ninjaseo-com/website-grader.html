                    <p>There is nothing quite like a website to get the word out about a business. "<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/website-grader">To put it bluntly: your website is really freaking important!</a>".

Once you know what your website’s strengths and weaknesses are vis-a-vis the competition, you will be in a better position to optimize its reach. </p>

<h3>2. Determine Whether it Provides a Critical Review of the Site's Local Visibility</h3>
