                    <p>It’s not a secret that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about tremendous changes in e-commerce today. So many people were forced to shop online during the lockdown/quarantine period. This increases the sales of e-commerce outlets like Amazon. <a href="http://theguardian.com">Amazon’s net income</a> reportedly increased to $6.3 billion in the third quarter of 2020. As the e-commerce market continues to flourish, the competition among e-retailers will only get tougher.</p>

<p>Data indeed lies in the heart of any business. To get ahead you have to work a mile in the shoes of an average search engine user. A search engine user garners pieces of information which is a composite of data.</p>

<p>For a more practical explanation. Let’s say you have an e-commerce outlet with a composition of different thousands of products. To stand a chance to compete with competitors in your industry. You have to ensure that your pricing is competitive as well. All these play out as the benefits of website crawlers.</p>

<p>But how will you do that?</p>

<p>By surveying your competitors’ websites and taking note of their pricing. Here’s where it gets interesting. If they also have thousands of diverse competitive products. It will be impracticable to carry out this survey without any automated process.</p>

<p>That’s where Web Crawlers are in play.</p>

<p>Web crawling is one of the potent ways of garnering information from various websites without any hassle. With web crawlers, you stand a chance to compete with the top dogs in your industry. Increasing your reach, your sales, and ensuring the growth of your business. But you must have a well-structured website that easily permits BOTS to crawl on your website.</p>

<p>However, before you can be included in the search engine, your content has to be stored and arranged in the course of the crawling process. This process is also known as indexing. Once this is done your page will be among the running pages to be displayed by the relevance of inquiries.</p>

<p>In a moment we will examine some of the benefits of Web Crawlers. But before we do that. It is important that you have a clear understanding of Web Crawling and how it works. Without any further ado, let’s get started. Shall we?</p>

<h1>What are Web Crawlers?</h1>

<p>Web crawlers simply refer to employing the use of software to obtain data either from various website pages or a couple of web pages. They are also known as a spider, spider bots, bots, robots, and many more. These names are somewhat descriptive in their functionalities. Which is crawling all over the World Wide Web to the index pages for search engines like Google.</p>

<p>However, search optimization engines do not randomly pinpoint sites subsisting on the net. It involves a process. I will try to explain the process in the best possible way comprehensible even readers that are not tech-savvy. To understand this process you have to know how the search engine works.</p>

<p>The search optimization engine has 3 basic functions namely:
● <strong>Crawling</strong>: This involves exploring the net for contents and going through each code of every found URL link. Here, the search engines send out a squad of robots to detect up to date contents. These contents could be in the form of a webpage, a video clip, a PDF document, or even an image file that is discovered by URL links. The crawling process is initiated by picking up and following a couple of web pages to find new URL links.</p>

<p>● <strong>Indexing</strong>: This is the storing and the arrangement of contents discovered in the course of the crawling process. Here, the search engines process and keep information in a database of all discovered contents that seem relevant to the searchers.</p>

<p>●<strong>Ranking</strong>: This function entails supplying every piece of content that is best relevant to a searcher’s inquiries. When a search is conducted, the search engines dig through for content that is highly relevant to solving searcher’s inquiries. The order in which these contents are arranged by relevance is known as ranking. However, it’s not a secret that the higher a website is ranked in terms of domain authority, the more relevant it is believed by the search engines employed during an inquiry.</p>

<p>Now that you know the basic functions we can now discuss how the process works, The programs are required crawling and indexing before they can be conveyed to the right pages for phrases and keyword search.</p>

<p>Every search engine comes with web crawlers (BOTS) that search through the internet for the indexing of web pages. The BOTS move swiftly from a web page to another looking through all the web pages and making duplicates of each of these pages. The duplicates are kept among other pages that have also been through the crawling process.  </p>

<p>Although, there are some instances when the site will go through the crawling process but wouldn’t be indexed. This implies that the crawler was either bugged or delayed. However, they will be indeed in due course.</p>

<h1>Why Web Crawlers Is Important</h1>

<p>Still wondering what the benefits of web crawlers are? The answer is right here!</p>

<p>By now you should know that your web content can be ranked in a search. You need to be indexed first and the BOTS has to constantly and successfully crawl your website. Any content that has not been indexed will not be found from any subsisting search engines. Just as I mentioned earlier the duplicates of your content have to be in the search engine before it can exist.</p>

<p>Although there are some hassle-free means of getting a website crawled a few times. But with a well-structured website, the crawling process will take place consistently. However, whenever you have new updates on your websites, you have to index your web pages again. This will ensure that it is ranked better. Any modification on your page to a large extent reflects quickly in the search engines. This can be advantageous to your site as the newness and date of the post are one major major ranking factor.</p>

<p>Consistency in the way the search crawl on a website is a significant factor in on-page SEO success. Therefore, you must have a well-structured site that permits the search engines to crawl your website frequently.</p>

<h1>Example of Web Crawlers</h1>

<p>While the most popular search engines all have Web Crawlers. The larger one possesses multiple Web Crawlers designed with specific focuses. For instance, the Google search engine possesses a main crawler known as Googlebot. Googlebot is the composition of both the desktop and the mobile crawlings.</p>

<p>However, the Google search engine has other BOTS like Googlebot images, Google BOTS Videos, AdsBots, and Googlebot News.</p>

● DuckDuckBot
● Baiduspider
● Yandex BOT
