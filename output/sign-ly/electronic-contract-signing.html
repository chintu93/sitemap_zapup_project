                    <p>Even to this digital era, electronic signature is gaining more and more popularity. However, many small and medium-sized businesses still use paper-based work for physical signatures in an old-fashioned manner.</p>

<p>Firstly, businesses that depend on paperwork consume more time and effort. Secondly, this tends to be very expensive. Moreover, when any mistakes appear on the document, this needs to go for printing and signing again.</p>

<p>Instead of spending too much time on getting it printed or faxed, why not make a shift towards embracing electronic signature technology. An electronic signature is entirely automated and can be available as and when needed as it is cloud-based. It smooths out your business functions without adding any hassle.</p>

<p>In this article, SMBs can learn about the 11 important things about electronic signature:

<h3><strong>#1 eSignature is more secure than a physical signature.</strong></h3>

<p>An eSignature is like a three-dimensional thumbprint that carries information about who signed what, where, when, and how. This information entails what the signature signifies, making it more secure than their handwritten counterparts.</p>

<p>The eSignature technology records every action signers takes during review and signing, such as clicking buttons to confirm records or checking boxes, etc. These provide user authentication and ensure cloud security as well.</p>

<h3><strong>#2 Electronic signatures are legal across all the states of the USA.</strong></h3>

<p>In addition to the ESIGN (Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce) Act, UETA (Uniform Electronic Transactions Act) is another electronic signature legislation in the USA. This has been adopted by only 47 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. While the remaining states, including Illinois, Washington, and New York, have not adopted UETA, many people think that electronic signatures are not accepted in these states.</p>

<p>The reality is the ESIGN Act is valid in all the US states by implementing other similar statutes that validate the legality of electronic signatures.</p>

<h3><strong>#3 Digital signatures and electronic signatures are different.</strong></h3>

<p>An electronic signature is an electronic sound, symbol or process associated with contracts. Businesses use it to approve or accept a contract. A digital signature, on the other hand, is a type of electronic signature. It uses an algorithm for producing a unique digital fingerprint for each document. The digital fingerprint is also called a hash. This is linked to the identity of the signer.</p>

<p>Both digital and electronic signatures can be used to sign contracts or documents legally. However, SMBs should understand local regulations before choosing either of these signing methods</p>

<h3><strong>#4 Improves customer relationships</strong></h3>

<p>Customers want their documents signed instantly, and close deals quickly. Thankfully, eSingature software, like Sign.ly allows businesses and customers to sign documents online within a few seconds. This not only saves time but also reduces the hassle of paperwork.

<p>Customers read documents online and sign them electronically from any corner in the world. Electronic software solutions make the process easy, simple, and fast while improving customer satisfaction.</p>

<h3><strong>#5 Do Not Require Technical Expertise</strong></h3>

<p>Using electronic signature technology is easy. SMBs can easily integrate eSignature platforms into their day-to-day applications, such as Outlook, Office 365, etc. This helps improve employee productivity and speed up transactions between multiple parties. A right electronic signature software, like Sign.ly helps deliver a highly intuitive user experience</p>

<h3><strong>#6 Electronic signatures and wet-ink signatures have the same legal status</strong></h3>

<p>The eIDAS Regulation (Electronic Identification and Authentication and Trust Services) in the E.U. and the ESIGN Act in the US enforce the same legal effects and validity of both electronic and wet-ink signatures.</p>

<p>Presently, more than 60 countries have established their own standards and laws for electronic signatures that make them legal.</p>

<h3><strong>#7 Quick Turnaround Time</strong></h3>

<p>Electronic signatures provide a much faster turnaround. You don’t have to send documents to one party, print, sign, and scan it, and then sending it to the next party. The whole process takes only a few seconds that provide businesses greater versatility when it comes to time sensitivity.</p>

<h3><strong>#8 Support the majority of file formats</strong></h3>

<p>File formats, whether PDF, Open-Office, MS-Office, Text, RTF, HTML, CSV, images (JPG, BMP, PNG, TIFF), and many more. Most of the eSignature software solutions support most of the file formats available.

<p>For instance, Sign.ly is an excellent tool for the purpose. Using this tool, you can electronically sign almost all types of file formats. The software keeps adding many new features to facilitate more convenience and improved user experience with the electronic signature technology.</p>

<h3><strong>#9 There’re Three types of electronic signatures.</strong></h3>

<p>There are three types of eSignatures: SES (Simple Electronic Signature), AdES (Advanced Electronic Signature) and QES (Qualified Electronic Signature).</p>

<p><strong>SES</strong> is defined as data in electronic form attached to other data in electronic form. It is used by the signatory to sign.</p>

<p><strong>AdES</strong> is an advanced and more secure form of eSignature. It can identify the signer, and you can even detect is someone has tampered with the signature.</p>

<p><strong>QES</strong> is an advanced electronic signature that a qualified electronic signature creation device creates, and it is based on a qualified certificate for eSignatures</p>

<h3><strong>#10 Basic Requirements For Legal eSignatures</strong></h3>

<p>An electronic signature must conform to all requirements in the ESIGN Act and the UETA:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Intent to sign:</strong> Each signer purposely signs the contract.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parties agree to business electronically:</strong> All parties involved must give their consent to do business electronically. They must obtain a UETA Consumer Consent Disclosure and agree to use electronic records.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Signature’s Association With Record:</strong> The system used for transactions must record the process entirely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Record retention:</strong> eSignatures must be retained and reproduced.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>#11 Mistakes can be fixed</strong></h3>

<p>What if you signed on a wrong document that is paper-based? In this scenario, you have to send it for printing and get signed it again. But with e-signature, it is very easy to erase and sign it again even, if any mistake happens.</p>

<p>Simply upload a corrected version to be reviewed and signed. This saves time and money over weeks, months, and even years when documents can be distributed in seconds.</p>
