                    <p>A paperless office is everyone's dream. However, to fully achieve this you need to make the right choice when to comes to electronically sending, signing and storing important documents. That's where an electronic signature services provider comes in.</p>

<p>An electronic signature (e-signature) is a digital mark indicating agreement to a contract or document. For example, when you sign your name on a courier's mobile device — that's an electronic signature. How much time do you waste signing documents? You format and print off a document, sign it, scan it into your computer, and (usually) reformat it again before sending. As a one-off, this doesn't sound too bad. However, repeated dozens and dozens of times, it becomes a chore.</p>

<p>That's where electronic signatures come to the rescue — they let you sign documents in seconds. And companies are quickly realizing the benefits, seeing as the number of worldwide e-signature transactions jumped from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/618202/worldwide-esignature-transaction-annually/">89 million in 2012 to 754 million in 2017</a>. </p>

<p>To be fully digital, however, you need the right tools to electronically send, sign, and store important documents like contracts. This is where electronic signature services providers come in.</p>

<p>Today, we have the technology to make a <a href="https://twitter.com/AdvanceNetGroup/status/1228218110357852160?s=20">paperless environment</a>. But to make that leap, we have to understand the benefits of free online signature service. Electronic signature services providers allow you to sign paperwork digitally. These software give users the ability to gather signatures on documents shared electronically, eliminating the need for physical documents to record signatures and facilitate the distribution of legally sensitive documents for the collection of electronic signatures. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, how do you know which one is ideal to the peculiarities of business? For this reason, we have made a shortlist of the best electronic signature services providers out there.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Great Electronic Signature Services Provider?</h2>

<p>Let's start with the basics: the most important feature in any electronic signature services provider is the ability to add an electronic signature. The easier it is to create and store that signature, the better the experience. But there's more to an electronic signature services provider than just the signature. It is especially useful if you can send the document for other people to sign and then track its progress from a unified dashboard. It's a big plus if you can invite others to collaborate when creating the paperwork, too.</p>

<p>Before you invest in a specific piece of software, you may want to double-check the security features offered to know if they meet your business or personal needs. What qualifies as a legally binding signature can vary by country, and different types of documents may have different requirements. Compliance and security information is usually provided on the provider's website.</p>
