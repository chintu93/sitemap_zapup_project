                    <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

<p>As consumer-oriented businesses, organizations with sales teams are always looking for the “next big thing.” One of the undeniable “next biggest things” was the movement towards digital transformation.</p>

<h2><strong>What is digital transformation?</strong></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/what-is-digital-transformation">Enterprise Project</a> defines digital transformation as “the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business resulting in fundamental changes to how businesses operate and how they deliver value to customers. ” What this is can differ from organization to organization. For some, they may need to gear their sales towards those that are more likely to purchase digital products. For others, it may mean changing the sales process itself to include digital technology. For many, it means both.</p>

<h2><strong>Digital transformation’s integration into sales</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Social selling</strong></h3>

<p>As a result of technological advancements, social selling has become more popular among sales teams. With the ability to create relationships with potential customers and returning customers, sales strategies have taken a new direction.</p>

<p>Social selling involves determining where your target audience is, digitally speaking, and regularly sharing quality content with them on those platforms. It doesn’t necessarily mean talking about a specific product or service you offer as much as it is engaging with customers and providing information relevant to them to boost your business as knowledgable and friendly.</p>

<p>Social selling also includes the vast amount of reviews customers can find online about products and services. As a result of social selling, customers tend to be much more informed before ever making a purchase. It is something that sales teams are more likely to embrace and not resist.</p>

<h3><strong>Digital strategies</strong></h3>

<p>Many leading sales organizations are adopting digital strategies, investing in the resources and tools to make it happen. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/07/21/7-examples-of-how-digital-transformation-impacted-business-performance/#19a52b4651bb">Forbes,</a> this strategy has paid dividends for businesses like Best Buy and Home Depot who both went from solely product-oriented businesses to more IT service-oriented.</p>

<p>Though digital transformation requires a commitment of both time and money, the ROI is proving to be worthwhile for many organizations.</p>

<h3><strong>Why digital transformation is preferred over the traditional sales approach</strong></h3>

<p>Technology simply makes life easier…unless it doesn’t. With the right, intuitive and user-friendly tools at your employees’ fingertips, they are more likely to at least give it a try. Then, once they see how much easier their tasks are as a result of these technologies, they tend to embrace the new technology. Employees will find that their sales processes will change for the better, encouraging them to move away from their traditional sales approaches and towards digital alternatives.</p>

<h2><strong>How technologies are changing the way we sell</strong></h2>

<p>As a result of digital transformation, there are several technologies that have changed how we approach sales. The below lists just a sampling of these technologies.

<h3><strong>1. Analytics</strong></h3>

<p>Actionable analytics about your customers’ behaviors, actions and tendencies will help you see patterns and base your futures sales on these patterns.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Content fluidity</strong></h3>

<p>Marketing content is extremely important in your sales strategies. However, if you don’t modify your content based on how well your potential customers are responding to your content, you are missing the mark.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Data-driven</strong></h3>

<p>Using the data from your analytics, your approach can be much more trustworthy than a “gut-feeling” or a sales approach not driven by your data.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Cloud computing</strong></h3>

<p>Cloud computing has had a huge impact on how we do business and how we sell our businesses. Information is at our fingertips and decisions can be made immediately, even while on the go. It has also proven to be very cost-effective without the need for extra hardware or server maintenance.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>There are many reasons for organizations to consider a digital selling strategy. First of all, planning digital strategies simply drives business growth. Digital strategies encourage innovation, increase collaboration, provide organizations with actionable insights and enable employees to make processes much quicker and easier.</p>

<p>Digital transformation has even helped provide sales teams with easy, secure and quick means for signing contract documentation, invoices, notices-to-proceed and much more. Sign.ly by 500apps is an enhanced example of this type of digital means to speed up your sales processes. Initiating secure signature software such as Sign.ly is another step towards reaching total digital transformation throughout your organization.</p>

<p>You don’t need to invest all of your time and money into a complete digital transformation, but moving your sales processes more towards technologies will prove to help your ROI increase substantially.</p>
