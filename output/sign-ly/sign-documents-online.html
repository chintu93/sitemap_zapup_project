                    <p>Businesses are increasingly shifting from paper to electronic signature software when it comes to signing contracts. The <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/digital-signature.asp">global e-signature market</a> is expected to rise from $663 million in 2016 to $2.66 billion by 2021.</p>

<p>This is because e-signature is highly beneficial to organizations, large or small. Before we discuss how this technology helps transform businesses, let’s understand what exactly an electronic signature is.</p>

<h2><strong>What is an electronic signature?</strong></h2>

<p>An e-signature (electronic signature) is an electronic sound, process or symbol legally attached to a record. It is executed by a person for signing records with the intent to approve the content of an electronic document legally. Such documents are legal, secure, tested, auditable, and verifiable. The process is performed using e-signature software.

</p>

<p>Similar to its handwritten counterpart, an e-signature is a legally recognized means of demonstrating the intent of the signer that s/he will adhere to the terms of the contract they’ve signed.</p>

<p>Whether you’re signing a mortgage, a document for business partnerships, a vendor contract or anything, e-signature software solutions offer many significant benefits.</p>

<p>Sign.ly lists below how a reliable e-signature software can transform and help grow your business. Also, learn how these solutions are beneficial as compared to traditional pen and paper signs.</p>

<h3><strong>#1 Businesses can sign different file formats online.</strong></h3>

<p>PDF (Portable Document Format) is the most common document supported by e-signature software. However, there are instances when you have to sign a file without converting it into a PDF.</p>

<p>The good news is e-signature software supports various document types such as excel sheets, images, word documents, presentations, etc.</p>

<p>Some e-signature software like sign.ly allows you to even change the document from one format to another, putting you at ease.</p>

<h3><strong>#2 Businesses can customize their signatures for brand promotion.</strong></h3>

<p>Good e-signature software supports multiple signature types. There are mainly three different types of electronic signatures used across businesses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Simple electronic signature:</strong> This is as simple as writing your name under an e-mail.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advanced electronic signature:</strong> Can identify the signatory, and signatory can retain control over the document. All changes within the file are detectable using a public-key infrastructure (PKI) that uses certificates and cryptographic keys.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Qualified electronic signature:</strong> This is created by a qualified signature creation device. This type of e-signature uses a qualified certificate.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>An e-signature software also supports customizable signatures. Whether you want to draw, upload, or type your signature, you can achieve this with e-signature software like sign.ly. You can add signees, custom fields to the signature and customize a template to save time.</p>

<p>Moreover, these tools support batch signing, multiple signatures on a single document, and signature in multi-languages.</p>

<h3><strong>#3 You can access and sign documents on any device.</strong></h3>

<p>E-signature software synchronizes your documents between all your devices using cloud storage. You can sign, send, and track your contracts or files anytime and anywhere using any Internet-enabled device.</p>

<p>You can enable and access your documents from your personal computer, tablet, laptop or even mobile devices.</p>

<p>The cloud capability also provides an extra layer of security, as they require a sign-in for every access.  </p>

<h3><strong>#4 Businesses have a cost-effective signing solution.</strong></h3>

<p>One of the key benefits of e-signature technology is it doesn’t involve the use of ink and printer. Also, it reduces the use of faxing. You also save money on printer purchases and maintenance, and courier services. You can close contracts within seconds, even with people sitting miles away from you.

</p>

<p>Additionally, you can easily manage tasks like database searching, e-filing, etc. This cuts down business expenses and the time required for business processes.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.aiim.org/pdfdocuments/MIWP-DigitalSignatures-2013.pdf">AIIM report,</a> 25% of e-signature users gained revenue within just three months, while others benefited within a year. This is because e-signature saves businesses time looking for lost documents, rekeying data and filing papers.</p>

<p>Above all, e-signature software solutions like sign.ly come at a very lost cost that even small businesses and startups can afford and benefit from this technology.</p>

<h3><strong>#5 You can close deals faster.*</strong></h3>

<p>Because e-signature makes it easy and fast to sign documents online, this improves the contract turnaround time. You can quickly execute contracts with multiple signers. You can invest your saved hours concentrating on your core business activities.</p>

<p>An e-signature software automatically routes all documents to the individual signer. You send and get the document signed in a few minutes, and this facilitates faster payments and speeds up the sales cycles by up to 400 percent.</p>

<h3><strong>#6 You can ensure and upgrade document security.</strong></h3>

<p>Paper contracts and documents are highly vulnerable to tampering, which can be risky for your enterprise. Even if you store them safely, someone could break in and tamper or steal your documents without leaving any traces.</p>

<p>You can avoid these risks using advanced e-signature software products. E-signatures provide strong document security and add legal value to your files.</p>

<p>Each signature features a tamper-detection seal that sends alerts if someone alters the document after signing.</p>

<p>Additionally, e-signature software provides a detailed log of actions performed on the document or contract. This clearly shows who downloads the copy, when a recipient signed the file and everything.</p>

<h3><strong>#7 Your business becomes eco-friendly.</strong></h3>

<p>E-signatures reduce paperwork and human typo errors, which further cuts down carbon footprints of your business.  To store a large volume of records, you may need temperature-controlled rooms featuring advanced fire suppression systems.

</p>

<p>Sometimes, due to moist, mold occurs in the storage area, and it may cause substantial environmental problems. Moving to an e-signature software saves our planet and reduces paper consumption.</p>

<p>Another indirect way in which you save the environment by adopting e-signature is by avoiding greenhouse gases. Since you don’t have to travel much for meetings to get your contracts signed or to carry documents between destinations, it cuts down greenhouse gases emitted by automobiles. </p>

<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>

<p>Now that you are familiar with the incredible benefits of using electronic signature software, it’s the right time to choose the one for your business. Sign.ly can be an ideal pick if you are looking for a reliable, customizable and feature-rich e-signature solution.</p>

<p>Businesses adopting this technology can speed up their transactions, improve their performance and deliver an enhanced customer experience.</p>
