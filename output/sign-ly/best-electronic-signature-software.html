<p>In this era of digital transformation where information at all levels can be captured, delivered, processed, and represented electronically, businesses run risk of failing if they don't keep abreast with the changes in the digital world. </p>

<p><span class="bg-secondary d-block mb-0 p-5 quotationtext rounded text-white">This was summed up quite aptly by Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, when he said, ‚ÄúThere is no alternative to digital transformation. Visionary companies will carve out new strategic options for themselves ‚Äì those that don‚Äôt adapt, will fail."</span></p>

<p>If a couple of decades ago, the concept of signing digital documents was hard to imagine, twenty years later, electronic signature technology has proven to be a great technological innovation and has become essential to workflow improvement even more so due to the Covid 19 pandemic which has increased the need for remote working. Research by <a href="https://twitter.com/Gartner_inc/status/1322912548203745280?s=20">Gartner</a> shows that 48% of employees will work remotely some or all the time post-Covid 19. </p>

<p>An electronic signature, also known as e-signature, is defined as ‚Äúany electronic proof that indicates acceptance of an agreement or record‚Äù. An e-signature can replace a handwritten signature in virtually any process, even legally. On the other hand, Electronic signature software is software that allows you to sign such paperwork digitally. If you've ever put your signature on a form without touching pen to paper, you've most likely used electronic signature software. These platforms allow users to add legally binding signatures to documents using a computer, smartphone or tablet. This eliminates the need to print, scan or fax paper copies.</p>

<p>As you can see, it is important that you choose the best electronic signature software for handling such a delicate task.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Best Electronic Signature Software For You</h2>

<h4>Step 1: Legality</h4>

<p>Some industries accept electronic signatures, while others don‚Äôt. Similarly, state regulations dictate when they are acceptable. So, before doing anything else, you first have to confirm the rules with bureaucracies or higher-ups. Note which industries or departments permit this type of process, and shortlist software that abide by their policies.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Business Size</h4>

<p>Different business sizes and industries benefit from specific features from what they consider to be the best electronic signature software. In that sense, you should determine your organizational capacity and the narrow-most industry it operates in. Scouting through industry-specific and size-specific apps will help narrow down your options. Doing so also prevents you from paying for features that you won‚Äôt need.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Define Your Needs</h4>

<p>Your industry and business size already provide a structure for your document-related needs. It‚Äôs time for you now to choose your preferences. For instance, you might prefer a software that supports multiple languages. Or maybe you would need an app that sends a reminder to signatories when it‚Äôs time to sign a document. List down whatever you need to further narrow your options down to the must-haves.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Define a Budget</h4>

<p>In the process of choosing the best electronic signature software that‚Äôs ideal for you, your budget should always be the last step. This way, you don‚Äôt settle for the cheapest software in the market. Given the last three steps, you now have a streamlined list of your must-have platforms. Draw up a budget and select a solution that aligns best with it.</p>

<h2>Important Features That the Best Electronic Signature Software Have</h2>

<h4>1. Security and Privacy</h4>

<p>Since solutions of this type often house sensitive transactions, security is a primary factor to consider. Data protection and privacy are important for every client. When e-signing documents, we‚Äôre actually transacting personal information online, which makes security an imperative feature for every e-signer. Information must be technically protected, and access must be secured with multi-approved privileges and proactive protection policies. Even if the program is used by multiple employees at a time, each of them should rely on his right to reveal information selectively, and to do transactions discreetly. </p>

<h4>2. Compliance</h4>

<p>Electronic signature solutions have specific industry standards and policies with which to comply. Moreover, some apps need to adhere to country-specific laws and regulations. If an e-signed document does not comply with industry requirements, it may have legal consequences, and the company will be held responsible for activating it. </p>

<h4>3. User-friendly: Scalability and Integration</h4>

<p>The best electronic signature software must be one that is easy to implement and use would be widely accepted by your employees, stakeholders, and customers. In the same vein, e-Signature apps should be able to deploy signatures across different platforms. The software you choose should be compatible with other document and workflow management systems you use in your organization, as that would minimize your human efforts and speed up your business processes. It should also be designed to respond to multiple businesses and industries, that is, scalability. This would allow it to accept increased volumes of documents without performance being obstructed. </p>
