                    <p>They say that by failing to plan, you are planning to fail.</p>

<p>In the business world especially, this could not be truer. Because without proper planning among team members, no team would be able to collaborate effectively and achieve desired results. And without the right tools and technology, planning would be impossible within a team. Projects would forever be stuck in places or would miserably fail.</p>

<p>In fact, a lack of proper management and planning of projects in businesses invariably results in huge losses for the company, not to mention expensive failures. Statistics suggest that for every $1 Billon invested by businesses in the US, around $122 Million was apparently wasted owing to a lack of project performance.</p>

<p>This lack of performance can possibly be attributed to a number of factors including absence of clear goals, or communication gaps or untimely completion of tasks etc. <a href="https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pulse-of-the-profession-2017.pdf">Findings by the PMI</a> stated that a lack of clear goals was one of the most important factors contributing to project failure, followed by poor communication.</p>

<p>On the flip side, a report by PwC showed that 77% of high performing projects in businesses used project management software.
Evidently, the right project planning tools can work like magic.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a lot of project managers are starting to realize that. According to the <a href="https://www.capterra.com/project-management-software/user-research/">Project Management Software User Research Report</a> by Capterra, adoption of project management software is on the rise.</p>

<h1>What is a team planning tool?</h1>

<p>Simply put, a team planning tool or a project planning tool is a digital platform from which managers can control and manage projects in their team. It helps them plan, manage and optimize the use of resources within a project and helps put the resources to the best use for maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>Typically, project management tool providers offer useful features for project management, task management, collaboration and performance tracking. All of these features together enable the manager to plan projects with team members and execute them by making the best use of assigned resources. </p>

<h3>Some of the common features include:</h3>

<p><strong>Collaboration</strong> - Helps collaborate with team members and work on projects with a unified goal. Also helps remove ambiguities and make communication easier and faster.</p>

<p><strong>File sharing among team members</strong> - Helps share files and documents with team members for effective data updates</p>

<p><strong>Task management and monitoring</strong> - Helps create tasks, assign it to team members and monitor them for performance</p>

It is a carefully designed tool that caters to the specific needs of projects undertaken by teams, and provides the much needed control over the affairs of the team.</p>

<h1>Why do you need a project planning tool</h1>

<p>A survey by <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/2034616">Gartner</a> showed that it was the larger projects that were always more prone to failing than small projects. However, irrespective of the size, half of all project failures were attributable to serious functionality issues and delays in task completion.</p>

<p>A team suffers from ineffective task completions and functionality issues solely because of a proper way to manage the tasks. Put together with communication issues and a lack of collaborative methods among team members working from different places, the projects are bound to fail.</p>

<p>It is to combat these issues and to prevent losses incurred from the failure of large projects, that a project management tool is used. It facilitates better communication among team members and allows teams to work on tasks simultaneously, while at the same time providing real time updates reflected on the dashboard for project managers to monitor.</p>
