<h2>Key factors to consider</h2>

<p>You must wisely choose the best intelligent automation platform software that can help devise optimal strategies for growth, boost return on investment, and invest more in cognitive resources. While making a decision, keep the following factors in mind -</p>

<h2>AI capabilities</h2>

<p>AI is an important aspect of intelligent automation systems. You must assess the AI capabilities of a platform before investing in it. You must choose a provider that genuinely offers its own AI capabilities without relying on a third-party vendor.</p>

<p>Using AI, the best intelligent automation platform software can learn from the existing and new data. It can draw insights from datasets and use those insights to further optimize the process. AI helps perform reliable data-driven decisions across the business processes. Some of the key benefits of AI-powered best intelligent automation platform software are - </p>

<ul>
<li>Improved customer experience</li>
<li>Optimized sales capabilities</li>
<li>Improved back-office efficiency</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use cases</h2>

<p>Just having AI is not sufficient for an intelligent automation platform software. It must also have some real-life use cases. It must have some real applications where it solves a business problem.</p>

<p>While looking for the best intelligent automation platform software, choose the one that has some proven use cases and pre-built accelerators. It must also be able to simplify complex tasks for your business.</p>

<p>You must also look at discovering novel use cases of the best intelligent automation platform software that might prove beneficial for your organization.</p>

<h2>Commercial model</h2>

<p>One of the primary reasons for implementing an RPA solution is cost reduction. So, you must be aware of the commercial models used by your automation platform vendors. This can help minimize implementation risks while making sure the financial goals are realistic and attainable.</p>

<p>The best intelligent automation platform software is the one that commits to your expected cost savings.</p>

<h2>Task automation</h2>

<p>Traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation">robotic process automation (RPA)</a> tools can easily automate repetitive and mundane tasks for your organization. But businesses these days are very complex as they deal with a lot of unstructured data. </p>

<p>The best intelligent automation platform software you are looking for must be capable of managing these complex tasks for your business. Look for a software that can deal with structured as well as unstructured data. It should be able to handle complexity.</p>

<p>Look for a platform that can work with a wide range of inputs irrespective of source, format, or language. You must be able to trust your automation solution to take care of complete roles like risk evaluation, data categorization, transaction monitoring, and document management, etc.</p>

<h2>Design process and innovation capability</h2>

<p>An important criterion that must be considered while selecting an intelligent automation platform software is the capability of the software vendor to understand your business workflow. A deeper understanding on the vendor's part makes it easier to produce innovative process design.</p>

<p>This will also be an important factor in determining the innovative capability of the partners. Your software partners should engage with your company's employees for process design.</p>

As per a survey by Cisco, 84% of respondents indicated that they care about their data privacy. Your RPA software should be capable of functioning perfectly even without utilizing consumer applications from big tech companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.</p>

<h2>On-premise implementation</h2>

<p>With tight data privacy laws across the world and the risk of data leaks, your organization must look for an intelligent automation software solution that can be deployed on-premise.</p>

<p>Having user data in your private cloud servers is always preferred over having it on off-site servers. This also gives you flexibility in business operations.</p>

<h2>Low-code software</h2>

<p>As per Capgemini, no-code and low-code are one of the <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/TechnoVision-2020-Report-web-2.pdf">top 20 business technology trends</a> to watch out for in 2020.

So, having the best intelligent automation platform software solution that lets you implement quickly and can be maintained easily can be beneficial for your organization.</p>

<li>Governance model</li>
<li>Development approach towards comprehensive solutions</li>
</ul>
