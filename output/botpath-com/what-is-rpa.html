                    <p>RPA is a form of business process automation that allows anyone to define a set of instructions for the bot to perform. RPA delivers significant business benefits, and this article will talk about those benefits. RPA enhances companies to experience greater productivity, accuracy, cost savings, higher ROI, cross-platform integration, improved customer experience, and scalability.</p>

<p>This article will talk about the basics of RPA, its functionality, benefits, setting it up, and more.</p>

<h2>What is RPA?</h2>

<p>RPA is the Robotic Process Automation that has a positive impact on the business operations of the customers. There are various benefits that a business can reap by using RPA. It is a technology that enables you to configure the software or a robot to perform the same actions that a user can do while interacting with the digital system for executing a business process. There is a rich user interface that the RPA will use to collect the data and access the applications just like humans will do. The RPA will trigger responses and establish a communication medium with the other systems to perform monotonous tasks. This is just one of the many functions that RPA can perform. RPA has made automation easy, improved functionality of a number of industries in many ways; let us know how: </p>

<h3>6.Optimally use artificial intelligence (AI)</h3>

<p>When you combine RPA with artificial intelligence, you can automate many tasks and extract around 80% of the data collected by the company and are not structured. In the procure to pay cycle, you can automate the invoice processing of the vendors. When it comes to the insurance companies, they can easily automate the process of extracting the claim details and identify the frauds with ease.

It leverages the already existing infrastructure while keeping the underlying systems intact.</p>

<h3>9.Easy to use</h3>

The knowledge workers do not have to waste their time doing mechanical jobs; instead, they can put their minds to something that is productive for the company. They no more have to spend time understanding the legacy systems or do repetitive tasks. There are tools available to streamline the work. The best one is screen scraping. However, it is not so intuitive for the employees. Today, RPA enables businesses to create bots with ease and improve ROI.</p>

<h3>10.Empower the employees</h3>

<p>There are multiple technologies that are integrated together and made into an interface that is simple for a user to understand. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are creating a new wave in the RPA </p>

<p>world. This is a breakthrough for the last two decades. The best thing about RPA is that it allows the employees to automate the tasks without the assistance of anyone. It is possible to execute the tasks ten times faster than manual jobs, and the tasks performed would be 100% free from errors.</p>

<h3>11.Easy to start, stop and scale-up</h3>

<p>The RPA will automate all the tasks that used to be carried out in a traditional way. You can use RPA in an environment and on any application. You can use RPA to scale up based on the demand and work with 100% capacity. The intelligent automation is capable enough to handle the data, which is unstructured. It automates the whole business processes. You can choose to run the number of robots you want to perform a task.</p>

The data can be documents, browsers, and many more.</p>

<p>The basic steps in the working of RPA include the following -
- Log into an application
-  Connect to system APIs
-  Copy and paste data
-  Move files and folders
-  Extract and process structured and unstructured content.
-  Read and write to databases.
-  Open emails and attachments
-  Scrape data from the web
-  Make calculations</p>

<p>RPA is a boon. Even when the whole world is sleeping, it is still awake and makes no errors that humans do! We have designed a tool for an error free automation of your business processes. Botpath (https://500apps.com/) is one of the multiple tools that we have created to automate the flow of your business functioning so that you get to focus on more relevant things rather than on redundant processes.</p>
