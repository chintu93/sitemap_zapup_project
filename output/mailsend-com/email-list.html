<h2>10 Email List-Building Tactics</h2>

<h3><strong>1. Include Personalized CTA for Blog and Landing page</strong></h3>

<p>Personalized CTAs have a higher chance to turn visitors into leads.  In fact, with personalized call-to-action buttons, you can double the number of email subscribers.</p>

<p><img src="https://mailsend.com/images/blog/include-personalized-cta-for-blog-and-landing-page.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Include Personalized CTA" /></p>

<p>Why miss such a great opportunity? Whether it’s a blog or a landing page, include a personalized CTA. Rather than offering advertising and sales pitch, share content that makes the visitors feel helpful and valuable.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Include a Pop-Up for Each Page</strong></h3>

<p>Are you wondering why we are talking about the old pop-up technique even in 2020? Well, pop-ups certainly can be annoying to everyone, but if you time it properly, it could be one of the best tools to get subscribers.</p>

<p><img src="https://mailsend.com/images/blog/include-a-pop-up-for-each-page.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Include a Pop-Up for Each Page" /></p>

<p>If a visitor, for instance, spends a certain amount of time on the page, you can show the pop-up message with relevant content based on that particular context. You may also consider exit pop-ups, scroll pop-ups, etc.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Generate more Landing Pages</strong></h3>

<p>Increase the number of landing pages and create personalized landing pages to entice a wider demographic. With more landing pages, you’ll be able to cater to each person’s individual concerns, resulting in more sign-ups.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Include Scroll Box</strong></h3>

<p>What is the perfect place to position the CTA button? Is it at the beginning of the page, or toward the bottom? There’s no clear answer right as it depends on various other factors including the visitor’s 
behavior. And in order to determine this, it’s important to conduct A/B testing.</p>

<p>Does your marketing campaign include a lot of advertising messages? This technique’s not going to work in 2020. Data shows that an individual receives more than 124 emails per day. So, trash will be the destiny of your sales pitches and advertisements.</p>
