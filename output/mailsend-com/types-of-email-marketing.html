<h3><strong>Promotional Emails</strong></h3>

<p>An offer is the best example of promotional emails. Time-specific offers are also part of promotional emails.

Offers, discounts which are available only for a specific period of time are also the best examples of promotional emails.</p>

<h3><strong>Billing Emails</strong></h3>

<p>Whenever customers make purchases, the confirmation receipt should also go to the customer through an email. Billing or receipt emails are the emails where confirmation is sent to the customer. Billing emails can also include a promotion or coupon code that can be used while making the next purchase.</p>
