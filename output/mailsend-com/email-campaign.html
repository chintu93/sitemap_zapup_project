                       <p>Content marketing has increased in popularity in the past decade or so, and for good reason. Focusing your marketing efforts on content increases your search engine optimization (SEO), for instance, as users find your content as they search for specific terms on their preferred search engine. Plus, it can show interested visitors that you know what you’re talking about. Thought leadership marketing, on the other hand, can propel your content marketing strategy effectiveness. </p>

<p>We’re going to take a look at how to create thought leadership marketing that is effective, but first, let’s look at what thought leadership is in more detail. </p>

<h2><strong>Thought Leadership Marketing</strong></h2>

<p>Content marketing is all about creating relevant and valuable content that your prospects and customers want to view. Content can involve text, video, or any other kind of content about your brand or products. If you want to up your game to more of a thought leadership strategy, you’re going to take this content and answer valuable questions or provide insightful information without making your focus on the brand or products.</p>

<p>Thought leadership marketing is a longer-term approach to content marketing.  It may not get you the hits you expect from your content at first, but, rest assured, it will get the hits eventually.</p>

</p>

<p>Most importantly, thought leadership marketing establishes you as an expert in your field. With new and insightful content to provide within your industry, potential customers will see you as an expert, and who better to purchase from then the expert in the field??</p>

<p>So, now that we’ve convinced you how much thought leadership marketing could improve your content strategy, let’s look at how to create effective thought leadership materials to develop a winning strategy. </p>

<h2><strong>Creating Effective Thought Leadership Marketing</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>1. Determine Your Goals</strong></h3>

<p>Decide what it is that you want to get out of your thought leadership strategy. Would you like to increase subscribers to your content? Reach a customer-base you haven’t reached yet?  Or a geographic region? Find out who your target audience is for this particular part of your marketing strategy and how to best reach them and with which kind of content.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Define Your Area of Expertise</strong></h3>

<p>If you are beginning your thought leadership marketing strategy, you’re on board with setting yourself up to be an expert at something.  This is where you want to make sure you are an expert at something and become the best in the business. Do some research to make sure there aren’t a million other experts out there who are putting out the same kind of content. </p>

<h3><strong>3. Find Your Subject Matter Experts</strong></h3>

<p>If you have people on staff that are particularly good at certain parts of your business that you plan to incorporate into your thought leadership strategy, by all means, recruit them to provide content. Even if they aren’t the best writers in the world, at least you can get the content from them while your marketing team cleans up the content. Or if you have marketing staff that is particularly good at researching aspects of your business that will make an impact, get them on board to provide content as well. </p>

<h3><strong>4. Know the Trends</strong></h3>

<p>If you’ve been in marketing for more than 5 minutes, you’ll know how important this step is in any aspect of your job. This is especially important in the tech industry where things change in the blink of an eye. Continuously do your research to stay on top of the trends...or, even better, ahead of them.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Create Impactful Content</strong></h3>

<p>Now comes the fun part. Creating the content will be the implementation of your thought leadership marketing strategy. A Thought Leadership Study by LinkedIn outlines a “flywheel” showing how best to create impactful thought leadership content. Though all of their points from their flywheel are valuable, we wanted to highlight just a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do some research on what others have written about and write about something else. This is a sure way you can lead the conversation.</li>
<li>Make sure your content is relevant to your industry and your audience. </li>
<li>Make sure it’s concise enough that people will want to view it.  Too much content or too much irrelevant content will turn them away from all of your content marketing.</li>
<li>Build trust. This is an opportunity to show your audience who you are and what you’re about and that they can trust your content.  Don’t blow it. Any misinterpreted data or grammatical errors may just lose them forever.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>6. Find Ways to Distribute and Engage</strong></h3>

<p>Now that you have your content, how do you get it to them?  You can put it on your website and your social media, but if they don’t follow you, how will they know? This is where <a href='email-marketing'>email marketing</a> can be your best friend. Distribute your content via email and give them opportunities to engage with you through email, chat, social media, your website, and more. </p>

<h3><strong>7. Measure the Effectiveness</strong></h3>

<p>Now that you’ve done the hard part, you can sit back and enjoy the benefits. But not entirely. You’ll want to make sure you can measure the effectiveness of your thought leadership marketing. Are people opening it?  Are they viewing it?  Are they going to your website or your social media profiles after viewing?  Make sure you have a way to analyze the data.</p>

<h2><strong>Types of Thought Leadership Content</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Newsletters</strong> - Newsletters are a great way to get your content out there to your audience and engage them by giving opportunities for them to connect with you and your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Ebooks</strong> - Ebooks not only provide a platform for your valuable content, but it is also a great way to collect email addresses by having users fill out a form to download them.  Plus, they can be perceived to be a “free book” in the eyes of your audience.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong> -  Videos are a valuable form of content as well, especially with younger target audiences. </li>
<li><strong>How-to guides</strong> - How-to guides are extremely informative and naturally the type of content that could deem you an expert in your field.</li>
<li><strong>Reports</strong> - Reports can be pretty broad or extremely focused and usually contain a great deal of data, which can be invaluable to your customers and prospects.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Leveraging Software</strong></h2>

<p>Leveraging software to help you with your thought leadership marketing is going to result in a huge return on your investment.  Depending on the software you choose, you can create and design your content marketing right within the tool and distribute it as well,  More importantly, some will offer analytics to show you exactly how your strategy is doing and what you can do to improve or change it.</p>
