                    <p>In a world where new and modern lead generation techniques are being discovered every day, email marketing still holds the number one position. Entrepreneurs and marketing executives all over the world swear by the power of email to grab customer attention and influence purchase decision. </p>

<p>In fact, customers prefer and expect companies to contact them through email for brand offers and deals, and a majority of them needless to say, are indeed influenced by email.</p>

<p>Working well both ways in a win-win situation, it is safe to say that email marketing is hands down one of the best sources of ROI for businesses even in the age of social media.</p>

<p>However it is also a complicated process for many companies, starting from list building to writing compelling copy to creating attractive newsletters and sending them out to the relevant people. </p>

<p>Some companies put in all the time and effort in the world to come up with genius email marketing campaigns, perfecting all the steps involved in the process, only to see no visible results. Emails remain unopened or unread by customers, with no substantial click-through actions.</p>

<p>For the same reason, a lot of companies are not very keen in using email marketing for their business.</p>

<p>However, the only reason why an email campaign doesn’t work for a company is because they are using the wrong strategy or because they are going wrong somewhere else in their efforts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/email-marketing-roi/">Studies</a> have shown that email marketing can generate much more sales than social media channels FB and Instagram. Apparently for every one dollar companies spend on email marketing, they’re able to generate $40 in sales.</p>

<p>Hence, a cleverly designed email marketing campaign, used along with the right tools is bound to work wonders for a company, both in terms of customer engagement as well as increase in ROI. </p>

<p>Being the most used and most accepted means of communication from brands by customers themselves, email marketing is both relevant and powerful today.
Once you work out the right formula to use it to your advantage and once you’ve tapped into the full potential of the marketing venue, email marketing can improve business revenue at exponential rates.</p>

<p>In order to make the most of email marketing, there are a few things you must look into.</p>

<p>The first step is to pick the right email marketing services provider</p>

<h2><strong>The right email marketing services provider</strong></h2>

<p>Just as important as coming up with a winning email marketing strategy is picking the right email marketing services provider. </p>

<p>Now there are a number of email marketing services in the market today and picking one solution out of the whole lot can be a little overwhelming. The only way to narrow down your options is to figure out your organizational needs first, along with the specific needs of your sales and marketing teams, and picking only the ones that offer features to meet those needs. </p>

<p>It is not about having all the features, rather it is about having the relevant features. Because above a feature-rich solution, you need a useful solution.</p>

<p>Apart from organizational needs, you also need to consider flexibility and customization for your solution. As you know, a one size fits all approach does not work with technology. Hence your email marketing services provider must offer customization features so that you can fine tune it to fit your unique business model. If need be, you can add or remove a few extra features and adapt the solution to your environment.</p>

<p>Lastly, you also need to check for software integrations in your solution. It is only through proper integration that you will be able to get the most benefits out of your email marketing solution. With integration you can connect your email with other applications and ensure effectiveness. For example, it allows you to connect your email campaigns with SMS and other optimization tools that make sure your email does not end up in the customer’s spam folder.</p>

<p>All of these are important factors to consider when picking your email marketing services provider as you ideally want a solution that adapts well to your specific needs. Not the other way round.</p>

<p>That being said, here are a few other essential features to look for in your email marketing solution.</p>

<ul>
<li>Email newsletter builder</li>
<li>Subscriber management</li>
<li>Email campaign builder</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, for a customer that always seems to bounce at your product pricing page, and often enquires about pricing on your social media, your product price is probably what is holding them back. Once you study the particular customer’s analytics, you can create an attractive email with a good deal or a good discount, in order to induce the customer to make a purchase.</p>

<h3><strong>Mobile friendly emails</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://mailsend.com/images/blog/email-marketing-services-mobile-friendly-emails.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Mobile friendly emails" /></p>

<h3><strong>Segmentation for targeted campaigns</strong></h3>

<p>In email marketing it is important to send only relevant emails to the relevant people. Too many irrelevant emails can cause a customer to unsubscribe from your list. Moreover, customers will only be induced to take action on seeing relevant content.</p>

<p>For these reasons, subscriber management and segmentation are extremely important email marketing services that you absolutely need your solution to have. With efficient segmentation features you can categorize your contacts and filter out groups of people with common interests or goals. Based on the analytics of each group you can craft effective personalized marketing emails and send it to them for maximum effectiveness.</p>
