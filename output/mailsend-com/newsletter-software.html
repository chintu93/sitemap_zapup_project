                    <p>Newsletters are an established effective way to connect with readers. The numbers have been proving it for the past several years.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://uplandsoftware.com/postup/resources/blog/email-newsletter-statistics/#:~:text=Newsletters%20create%20engaged%20audiences.&amp;text=You%20may%20see%20even%20higher,than%20visitors%20from%20other%20channels.">statistics</a>, publisher newsletters have an open rate of up to 22%. This means that 22% of the customers you send out emails to will definitely see your content. In comparison to Facebook, the same value turns out to be only a fraction of your Facebook audience.</p>

<p>This is because email marketing is still one of the most powerful ways to reach out to customers. Apparently almost <a href="https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/email-statistics/">269 Billion emails</a> are sent per day, with 4.3 Billion users around the world.</p>

<p>And according to a <a href="https://marketingland.com/77-percent-of-us-want-to-get-marketing-messages-via-email-theres-no-close-second-place-study-says-9420">study conducted by ExactTarget</a>, 77% of people prefer receiving marketing messages through email, without any other close second medium.</p>

<p>With all of these figures, it is pretty clear why email marketing still tops the list of email marketing strategies for businesses, especially in B2B, even in this digital age. It is a gold mine of opportunities. Attractively created newsletters with enough substance and cleverly crafted personalized subject lines are bound to induce customers to not only open and read, but also click through to your website or landing page.</p>

<p>This is precisely why it is important to put in ample thought and creativity into creating email newsletters. They hold the potential to convert a marketing qualified lead into a sales qualified lead and maybe even a sale.</p>

<h1>What exactly is a newsletter and what does it contain?</h1>

<p>A newsletter is an online message that is sent to customers on a regular basis for marketing purposes. The intent can be anything from making announcements about new product launches, informing customers about changes to the brand or products, notifying customers about offers and deals and following up with other relevant information.</p>

<p>It is tailored in a visually attractive way with engaging content meant for any of the purposes mentioned above. 
For example, a clothing brand may send weekly or daily newsletters on amazing offers and deals on their eCommerce store, while a software solutions provider in B2B may send weekly newsletters about insights and blog content on different software topics, which are basically meant to showcase the companyâ€™s expertise on the subject.</p>

<p>Typically an email newsletter will contain the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>An attention grabbing subject line</li>
<li>A body with engaging and useful content meant to induce action from the reader</li>
<li>Interesting graphical elements to make the newsletter attractive</li>
<li>Links to direct the readers to different sources</li>
<li>A CTA to induce action</li>
</ul>

<p>Links and graphics are not essential elements of a newsletter, although companies typically do include those in order to make it easy for the readers to take action.
As mentioned before, all of these elements will be tailored to the specific objectives of the email, depending on the type of business.</p>

<h1>What constitutes a good email newsletter?</h1>
