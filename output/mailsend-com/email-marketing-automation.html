<h2><strong>1. Welcome Prospects</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://mailsend.com/images/blog/email-marketing-automation-welcome-prospects.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Email marketing automation welcome prospects" /></p>

<p>It is not for nothing that they say that well begun is half done. The best way to attract prospects to become clients is to ask them to subscribe to your mailing list. That is something that an email automation software like <a href="https://mailsend.com/">Mailsend</a> makes eminently possible. Once you have a substantial mailing list with you, you can tailor your outreach campaigns to suit your purpose.</p>

<p>That people take email marketing very seriously is quite clear from this <a href="https://twitter.com/LeslieO/status/1341120364148121601">tweet</a></p>

<p><strong>Informal poll. Choose the #emailmarketing first sentence that yanks your chain the hardest:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I hate goodbyes, so I'm emailing you one last time.</li>
<li>I'll go ahead &amp; send your report.</li>
<li>Just bumping this to the top of your inbox in case you missed it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Welcome emails lead to four times the open rate and as much as five times a click through rate as compared to a normal email. A welcome email is very important because it is the very first communication that you have with the potential buyer after he or she has reached that stage in your association.</p>

<p>One stunning statistic about  welcome emails is the fact that only 57.7 % of the brands make use of them, yet they lead to as much as 320% more revenue than any other type of promotional emails.  Email automation software created customer focused and full of value welcome email breaks through a cluttered inbox and leads to the forging of a meaningful connection with one's prospects.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Enhance Product Usage</strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://mailsend.com/images/blog/email-marketing-automation-enhance-product-usage.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Enhance product usage" /></p>

<p>A concerted automated emailing campaign can goad prospects to avail of a free trial of your product  or service so as to eventually entice them to become buyers. This is important because most people would need to use and get to understand key features of a product, before they actually turn into paying customers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an automated email campaign gives a product or brand the opportunity to build relationships of trust with their prospects by the simple expedient of sending them information that they value from time to time. Once they have reposed their trust in you and believe in your word it becomes relatively easy for you to make them buy the products or services your pitch to them.
An electric vehicles manufacturer,for example, can connect with their prospects by emailing them the latest stats and figures pertaining to development in electric vehicle battery technology and get them interested in the concept over a period of time.
Once the electric vehicle manufacturing company is quite sure that the prospects have been sufficiently primed to believe in the usefulness of an electric vehicle, they can actually go ahead and make them an offer to sell them just that.</p>

<h2><strong>3. No Intervention Required</strong></h2>
