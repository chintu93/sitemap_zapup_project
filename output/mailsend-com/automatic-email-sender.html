This is where one can use email automation to great advantage.  Rather than sending individual reminders you can automate the process.  You can do that with the help of triggers.</p>

<p>Newsletters or other kinds of one-off campaigns sent have to be sent together to a bunch of people. An automatic email campaign, on the other hand,  has to be set-up once to be sent across to specific individuals on their conforming to a specific trigger.  It would, for instance,  be very inefficient to  implement an email-campaign manually, for each and every person, who becomes a subscriber.

<p>That's where email automation scores over traditional ways of sending out mass emails.  All you need to do is to  set up an email once.
