                    <p>Help desks have been in existence since the age of call centres. They basically serve as quick and easy ways for customers to reach out to companies and get a problem solved. And they play a huge role in creating satisfied happy customers. There are also a number of other benefits of help desk software.</p>

<p>Especially for small and medium sized businesses, help desk systems are very important as there is a need for them to make themselves available for their customers at all times. And since they may not be packed with resources given that they are just in their growing phase, they absolutely need help desk software.</p>

<p>In fact, almost <a href="https://financesonline.com/help-desk-statistics-analysis-of-trends-data-and-market-share/#:~:text=52%25%20of%20brands%20report%20that,for%20attention%2Ddemanding%20incident%20resolution">52% of brands</a> have apparently reported that using technology helps them deliver better customer service.</p>

<h1>What are help desk solutions?</h1>

<p>Help desk software solutions essentially provide a digital platform for customer service managers to handle customer queries, and get customer complaints resolved by the support team. They offer a single space from which to manage new queries and complaints and also make sure that the support team resolves existing queries on time. On the customer’s end, help desk solutions make sure that they get their problems resolved promptly and that they don’t have to wait for days on end for the same.</p>

<p>Suffice it to day, help desk solutions form inevitable parts in customer service, ensuring that no customer gets annoyed or irate over a problem they have with your product. By resolving problems quickly and on time, and by being available at the customer’s beck and call, help desk systems practically improve customer experience.
And according to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-service-stats">statistics</a>, 77% of customers would apparently recommend a brand to a friend after receiving just a single positive experience. We all know how powerful word of mouth is.</p>

<p>Shockingly, as per calculations, it would take at least 12 positive experiences to compensate for a single negative experience for companies. </p>

<p>Clearly, providing good customer service comes way before providing a good product. And offering a pleasant customer experience is more important than making a sale for a business.
A <a href="https://twitter.com/enterprisecon/status/1128013339584532483">study conducted by customer service consulting firm Walker</a> further reiterated the idea that customer experience will be the sole brand differentiator over product and price moving forward.</p>

<h2>Why do you need help desk software?</h2>

<p>Companies without a help desk software solution stand to invite a lot of irritated and annoyed customers. In fact the number one reason why customers churn or switch to a new brand is because they feel undervalued or unappreciated.</p>

<p>Time and time again, we’ve been told that in business, there is nothing more important than the customer. Personalized marketing strategies are developed for the sole reason of making customers feel valued and important. </p>

<p>The sad truth though, is that no matter how many personalized emails you send, no matter how attractive a newsletter you build, if you don’t have a system in place to get their product issues solved quickly, they are going to leave you. They will never stick with a company that keeps escalating their issue and keeps them waiting.</p>

<p>And this is exactly why you need a help desk solution.</p>

<p>Support.ly is an excellent help desk software solution that offers essential features as well as innovative features to help you in providing the best customer support. From an efficient ticketing system to multi-channel integrations to a reliable knowledge base, the solution comes with everything you need to sustain good customer relationships. </p>

<p>If you still need more reasons to make the decision, here are 10 benefits of help desk software.</p>

<h3>Benefits of help desk software</h3>

<h4><strong>Effective management of customer concerns</strong></h4>

<p>One of the biggest benefits of help desk software is of course perfect management of customer concerns. With a properly designed ticketing system and a dedicated group of support staff to work on the customer issues in good time, you can address and resolve queries and complaints in much less time, than when using a conventional manual help desk. As mentioned before, in this day and age, no customer has the patience to sit through escalations and wait for days to get their issue resolved. The sooner the company fixes a problem, the better are the chances for a customer to stick with you.</p>

<p>Support.ly comes with a top class ticketing system that helps register and prioritize customer queries. Its flow management features further help ensure that the tickets are opened addressed and sent back in a timely manner.</p>

<p><img src="http://support.ly/images/kp/benefits-of-helpdesk-software-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="Benefits of help desk software" /></p>

<p><strong>Faster resolution of customer issues with ticketing system</strong></p>

<p>The key to top notch customer service is fast resolution of issues. And to make sure that no issue goes unnoticed or gets buried in the thousands of issues flowing in, while resolving the registered issues promptly in a time gap of hours – there’s only way to do that. And that is by using an efficient ticketing system. It acknowledges the receipt of a query, puts it in queue for resolution and helps assign the ticket to a support executive for redressal. This way, the help desk manager is assured that the query is being taken care of and the customer is assured of resolution.</p>

<p>Support.ly comes with a prompt ticketing system to register customer queries, along with a flow management tool to help assign tickets to the support team and effectively follow up. It also supports tracking of queries and allows you to see exactly what is happening with respect of each ticket. This is perhaps one of most important benefits of help desk software.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt feedbacks for improvements</strong></p>

<p>A real time feedback system integrated with your help desk allows you to receive effective opinions and criticisms on the performance of your support team. It also allows you to get feedback on the content of your knowledge base. With this kind of real time feedback, you get to make real time changes promptly and in turn improve the overall customer experience.</p>

<p>Support.ly comes with a real time feedback system lets you collect feedback, implement changes, and follow up with the results. </p>

This is yet again one of the unique benefits if help desk software.</p>

<p><strong>Task and workflow automation to speed up repetitive jobs</strong></p>

<p>Customer support invariably involves a number of mundane, redundant and repetitive tasks, such as sending acknowledgement messages on receipt of query, assigning a ticket to the query, assigning relevant support staff for query resolution etc. These tasks are not only time consuming but also cause delays in resolving queries, with inefficiencies creeping in. Help desk automation features allow you to automate such tasks and speed up the entire process of customer support. Automation is not merely one of the benefits of help desk software, but also an essential feature to look for.</p>

<p>Support.ly offers automation features to speed up and streamline repetitive chores, with canned responses set up for common customer queries or questions.</p>

<p>Customizability is another important feature that immensely helps you adopt a smart help desk solution for your company. With customizable features in ticketing or task management, you get to create, add or remove capabilities to suit your unique business model. The perfect solution will thus help you better organize your entire customer support process and improve customer experience. Hence you must absolutely make sure that the solution you are considering is customizable, so that you can make the most out of the benefits of help desk software.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-set responses for faster problem solving</strong></p>

<p>Help desk solutions typically come with canned or pre-set response features to create automatic messages for common customer queries. This includes acknowledgement messages for queries, common or generic instructions to customers etc. These accurately crafted canned responses can allow you to promptly address inputs from customers and speed up the process while doing so. It eliminates the need for support staff to copy and paste the same message to be sent to each customer. This is perhaps one of the most thoughtful benefits of help desk software.</p>

For the customer support team manager it makes all resources related to a particular query, including the ticket number, the customer, the worker it was assigned to, the date it was opened or closed etc. available in a single place – the dashboard. This makes it easier for you to refer back in case of need anytime in the future. Being a unified platform is one of those benefits of help desk software that helps managers the most.</p>

<p><strong>Reports and analytics to make improvements</strong></p>
