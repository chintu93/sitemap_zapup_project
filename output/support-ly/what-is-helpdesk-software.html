                    <p>A helpdesk is essentially a single point of contact for customers to get in touch with you, and also for managers to handle customer communication and queries. It provides customers a window for reaching out, in addition to email, through which they can submit queries or complaints. It also provides managers a centralized source of information and management through which they can organize customer communication, resolve queries and manage the support team as well.</p>

<p>In other words, a helpdesk allows companies to offer reliable support services to customers and in turn, the best possible customer experience. </p>

<p>Typically, businesses make use of comprehensive help desk software to handle internal and external support services. As mentioned before, it acts as a centralized digital source of customer insights and also an efficient way to manage the support team.</p>

<h1>What is helpdesk software?</h1>

<p><strong>A brief history</strong></p>

<p>If we take a look at the history of the concept of help desks in business, we’ll find that it dates back to 1960. That was when call centres came into being, initiated by companies as a way for customers to submit complaints and queries for fast resolution. However, there was no proper method to manage the priority of the queries that came in.</p>

<p>Later in the year 1991, the concept of ticket management was established, by which support processes became a lot more organized. By 2014, when smartphones started gaining momentum, mobile integrated support services became the new norm. And now, bang in the middle of an increasingly digital generation, multi-channel customer support is the name of the game.</p>

<p>Support.ly is the perfect example of a comprehensive help desk software system that not only offers an Omni channel presence with phone, chat, email and social media integrations, but also comes with a number of attractive features like a reliable ticket system and a rich knowledge base for both customers and the support team to gain insights from.</p>

<h2>Why do you need helpdesk software?</h2>

<p>Customer experience, we all know, is the be all and end all of a business. Without a satisfied or happy customer, no amount of products or services can help you grow. To effectively sell your product or service and have customers coming back to you for more – that is what a business strives for. And for that, there are no short cuts but to offer the best customer experiences. </p>

<p>As  <a href="https://twitter.com/SandlerSalesPro/status/1330982967146110976">Sheila Lirio Marcelo rightly said</a>, forging strong relationships should be the focus of all businesses, whether it is with customers, or colleagues or partners.</p>

In fact, delay in addressing queries or resolving complaints, can drastically bring down your reputation and credibility in the eyes of the customers. This is why you need top notch help desk software to manage customer support.</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the benefits that you will receive on installing help desk software.</p>

<p><strong>Manage customer issues promptly from different channels</strong></p>

<p>Help desk software systems offer multi-channel integrations with which customers can submit queries or complaints from wherever it is convenient for them.

<p><strong>Automate tasks and streamline processes for better efficiency</strong></p>

These include sending acknowledgements of complaints of queries to customers on receipt of their input, sending notifications to support staff on following up with pending requests etc. </p>
