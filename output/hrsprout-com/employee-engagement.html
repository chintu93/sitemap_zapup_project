<p>Across all fields, the best results are always achieved when there is a greater sense of purpose and commitment to the task at hand other than mere financial gains or other forms of physical rewards. So yes, the employee is bound to do some work because the employer pays the employee a certain sum of money after a stipulated period of time or after a certain amount of work has been done. But, does the employee care about the reason why such work is to be done? What difference would it make if the employee was working tirelessly because they hope to actualize a certain goal?</p>

<h4>2. <strong>Allow employees take on Jobs that match their talents and develop their career</strong></h4>

<p>Employees love to actually provide solutions and even “play the hero” in most situations. The only way this can be done is if their core talents and strengths are well harnessed by ensuring they perform tasks that match those talents.</p>

<p>The unique capabilities of individuals are expected to greatly influence what gives them fulfillment and pushes their career forward. This uniqueness lies in every talent employed in a company but it needs to be identified, valued, and properly harnessed by backing employees to take on roles that match their talents and help advance their careers.</p>

<p>Doing this gives a strong of fulfillment which tends to keep them going throughout without even thinking about financial gains. This sense of fulfillment is drawn from the fact that their everyday activity is directed at a specific goal- their own goal.</p>

<p>Making an employee aware of the fact that they are very crucial to the achievement of a huge goal or greater objective and clearly showing how what they do fits in the bigger picture makes them know they are important.</p>

<p>Work gets boring when the everyday routine activities of an employee begin to feel like the same thing every other person is doing. They feel like “just another employee”. If you want them to be engaged, then that feeling has to go; they need to feel unique because they are. Their unique capabilities should be directed in the area that Best helps the company reach its purpose specifically.
It is important for an employer to know how an employee contributes to the company. Likewise, it is highly imperative for the employee to see and believe that what they do matters.</p>

<h4>4. <strong>Maintain communication and give feedbacks promptly</strong></h4>

<p>Engagement is a two-way street. If an employer demands it, then they should give it in return. It is necessary to actually care about the work done by the employee and ensure to show it by staying in constant communication with them as <a href="http://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/deniselyohn/2019/08/06/employee-feedback-is-good-for-employee-engagement-action-is-better/amp/">Feedback is good for employee engagement</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/employee-engagement-1.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="maintaining communication" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, you need to monitor the job progress when a task is being handled by an employee. You can pick out the innovations and ideas of the employee during implementation and their mistakes as well. The message this sends across to the employee is that their Work matters and that is one of the major drivers of engagement in any employee.</p>

<p>When good work is done, ensure to give honest and constructive feedback. It sends a clear message that their work is well appreciated. Furthermore, termly meetings should be held to get insights into the issues which each individual is facing with their work.</p>

<p>To view it from another perspective, caring about the employees is likely to promote a sense of loyalty in them which is also likely to make them care more about the organizational goals. This was well illustrated in <a href="http://twitter.com/jeffbezos?s=21">Jeff Bezos’</a> <a href="http://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders">letter to shareholders</a> that they intend to become “earth’s best employer and earth’s safest place to work”. </p>

<p>In this <a href="http://twitter.com/josh_bersin/status/1374367018204340234?s=21">Tweet</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/josh_bersin?s=21">Josh Bersin</a> a leading HR influencer emphasizes on the importance of learning in the workplace.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Importance of learning in the workplace. Excellent overview from ⁦<a href="https://twitter.com/thetimes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thetimes</a>⁩ .. and as the economy heats up this is just getting bigger. <a href="https://t.co/a2oBtPwar7">https://t.co/a2oBtPwar7</a></p>&mdash; Josh Bersin ✨ (@Josh_Bersin) <a href="https://twitter.com/Josh_Bersin/status/1374367018204340234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> clearly wants to make their workforce “family” by making them know that they care about how their fairing personally. Kyle Gouen, Founder and president of <a href="http://pawstruck.com/">Pawstruck.com</a> buttresses this point by stating that “If leaders and businesses want to see progress towards new levels of success, they need to start treating employees as people outside of their businesses” in this <a href="http://www.inc.com/young-entrepreneur-council/how-to-encourage-personal-professional-development-in-workplace.html">Article</a>.</p>

<h4>6. <strong>Employ the use of a communication tool</strong></h4>

<p>Employee engagement requires you to be in the whole work process across all the various steps and the most effective way of achieving this is having the employee and the employer all on the same place- a communication tool like <a href="http://hrsprout.com/">HRSprout</a>- exchanging ideas and work updates in real-time.</p>

<p>The benefits of a communication tool are numerous towards employee engagement. The tools help to strictly dictate the communication roles of the leaders and managers while also providing them with the key information to understand and correctly answer employee questions.</p>

<h4>7.<strong>Ensure transparency</strong></h4>

<p>Employees and employers need to work together as a team to actualize the organizational goals. To continually ensure that they buy into that idea and run with it accordingly, employers shouldn’t hide the truth from their employees.</p>

<p>It is important to inform all involved parties about any vital information as they unfold in the work process. This promotes trust.</p>

<h4>8. <strong>Reward meaningfully</strong></h4>

<p>Finding out what is meaningful to each employee and ensuring to reward them with those things when good work is done is very vital to get the employees engaged. These meaningful rewards help to establish a give-and-take balance which is bound to continue producing results so long both parties keep to their own end of the bargain.</p>

<p>Tangible appreciation helps to drive psychological meaningfulness. The benefits of good work should be well articulated and the employees should be well aware that you recognize good work and ready to appreciate and reward it meaningfully.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/employee-engagement-2.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="reward meaningfully" /></p>

<p>Now you need to be careful as what matters to different individuals differs accordingly. This is why you need to know your employees personally and know what matters to them so you can reward them with it. Money in terms of salary increments and bonuses, Job role promotion, freedom, and other perks mean different things to people; identify what works and reward your employee with them when they do good work.</p>

<p>Meaningful rewards show that the employees are appreciated and as shown in this <a href="http://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQfB4j1idnZthAdGWtJ-N693BHxFSZYi-QS02msjVQW89z3MyqXnaYIaeA&amp;s=10">Image</a>, 69% of employees say they would work better if they were more appreciated.</p>

<h4>9. <strong>Be Human</strong></h4>

<p>Our genius lies in our humanity. You need to accept the fact that the employees are humans and as such certain issues might come up in the work process. This doesn’t mean you should compromise work standards, instead, it hints at offering flexibility to allow employees to unlock their creative genius.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/employee-engagement-3.webp# kp-inner-img-mk" alt="be human" /></p>

<p>Being human entails allowing flexibility in various work constraints such as work hours or working from home amongst others. This flexibility stems from the fact that we as humans know things can always spring up at any time. Employees nursing kids for instance should be giving the freedom of flexible work hours so they can work at their own pace- with company deadline in view of course.</p>

<h4>10. <strong>Walk the talk</strong></h4>

<p>It is not enough to place outrageous demands on your employees.  It is more important that they see you performing at or above the standard you are demanding from them.</p>

<p>Walking the talk more or less summarizes employee engagement under the premise that all humans love to mean something, be appreciated, and be a part of something that matters. Therefore, when leaders and managers are setting a good example of being extremely invested in the Job, it sends the message that the organization is actually going somewhere and are not just dumping a lot of work and expectations on them.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Clearly, employee engagement is an attribute of most excelling companies and organizations. As such, any other company that desires results should work towards it because it helps to get and retain the right employees with the right state of mind best suited to move the company forward.</p>

<p>You can drive employee engagement by knowing your employees personally and identifying what makes them tick so as to reward them meaningfully with those things amongst other things.</p>

<p>Furthermore, being a more people-oriented organization preaches empathy. Empathy makes the employee feel valued and giving them a sense of indebtedness which is demonstrated in form of their emotional investment. This should not be done solely to get these reactions but due to the fact that we are human first before we are employees or employers.</p>
